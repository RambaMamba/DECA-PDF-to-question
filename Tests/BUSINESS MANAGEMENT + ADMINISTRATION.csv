standards and rules that dictate how laws will be enforced. Jurisdiction is the authority to decide how the 
law applies and to enforce the law.

Interest is charged. When an individual or business charges interest on money that another indivi dual or 
business borrows, a debtor-creditor relationship exists. An invalid contract and a sal e that is paid in full at

Inductive organization. Inductive organization starts with examples, facts, or reasons and s aves 
conclusions for last. When you need to persuade someone of something, inductive organization can  be 
especially helpful. This is the case for Alexis and her team. She knows that her boss won't necessaril y 
want to spend a lot of time and money on the project, so she starts by listing the benefits. If she start ed 
out with the costs, her boss would likely be scared off before she even had the chance to convi nce him. 
Deductive organization is the opposite of inductive organization. It starts with the conc lusion, and then 
moves to examples, facts, and reasons. This method of organization is best when delivering ro utine

productivity declines and costs of labor go up. When prices increase, businesses spend more to buy  the

of doing business. If prices continue to rise, productivity often declines because of incr easing labor costs.

Over-commitment can lead to a lower quality of work. It is important for workers to assess the ti me 
involved with a project before volunteering to work on it. When workers volunteer to take on too many

thoroughly and correctly, which affects the quality of the work. Dillon may not have the autho rity to

__________ attitude.

Transparent. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and inform ation of 
internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. Transparency is the quality of 
being just as one seems —trustworthy. When employees have expertise or personal insight that can help 
the business achieve its goals, they should share their knowledge with their employe rs. Sharing 
knowledge means that the employees have a transparent attitude; they are willing to share their k now-
how, and they are not deliberately concealing knowledge that will help the business achieve i ts goals. 
Although curious and cautious behaviors are desirable traits, they are not needed for effective kno wledge

",A. filing an infringement lawsuit against Lamar.,B. charging Lamar with obstruction of justice.,C. requiring Lamar to pay a licensing fee.,D. obtaining an arrest warrant.,"50. A 
Filing an infringement lawsuit against Lamar. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word u sed by a 
producer to identify a good or service.  To prevent unauthorized use of the trademark (or a similar 
trademark), the trademark owner should register the trademark with the government. If another company  
(Lamar) uses a trademark that is similar to one that has been previously registered (Seward), the origina l 
owner (Seward) can file an infringement lawsuit against the company (Lamar) to stop the unautho rized 
use. And in some situations, the owner can obtain monetary damages from the unauthorized user. 
Directly asking Lamar to pay a fee is not a legal action. Obstruction of justice is a formal cha rge in which 
the judicial system accuses an individual with the crime of withholding critical  evidence that can affect the

build a long-term relationship with a vendor must consider many factors. Most importantly, th e business 
must determine if the vendor has the resources to meet the business's needs. Some resources include 
the product availability, technical-system compatibility, customer service support, etc. T he vendor's 
project management computer program is not usually a primary consideration during the vendor -
selection process. The business's own target market is a marketing consideration for the busine ss rather 
than for vendor selection. The business's strengths and weaknesses are identified in its SWOT an alysis 
and do not directly relate to the vendor-selection process.

Ongoing cooperation. When a business is continuously willing to work with other busi nesses (e.g., 
vendors) to achieve their mutual goals, it is exhibiting ongoing cooperation. Ongoing  cooperation involves 
a willingness to negotiate fairly and to communicate (interact) openly and honestly on a continuous basis. 
These actions help build a trusting and favorable relationship. In most situations, a company  does not 
need to fully disclose all of its business information to its vendors —only relevant information.

Standing. Standing orders involve sending products at set intervals. This type of purchase or der is ideal 
for businesses that need the same amount of an item on a regular basis. In the example, SOA 
Manufacturing may need the bolts to produce its products. Because SOA knows that it generates a set 
amount of outputs in a certain amount of time, it advises its vendor (Colbert Company) to ship a certai n 
amount of bolts at intervals —every other week. An advance order is a regular order that is placed now 
with delivery requested at a future time (e.g., weeks, months). A seasonal order is an order that is pl aced 
for seasonal merchandise, such as snow shovels or beach umbrellas. An open order is an order for 
staple goods that is placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's im mediate 
requirements (e.g., time, price, quantity).

Suitable, understandable, and timely. Control is a management function that monitors the work effort. For 
managers to control business activities in an effective manner, control methods must be app licable for 
the situation (e.g., a graphic artist performs different activities than the plant manager), understand able 
so employees perform activities correctly, and timely (e.g., products are not shipped before the y are 
packed appropriately). Generally, effective control systems are also economical (cost effectiv e) and 
relevant. The rigidity, flexibility, transferability, responsiveness, and tangibil ity of the control system are 
often dependent on the situation.
