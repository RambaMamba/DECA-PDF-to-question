0,"1. A legally binding contract comes into being 
",A. only if drawn up by a lawyer.,B. whenever someone promises to do something in exchange for something.,C. when someone promises to give something to someone else.,D. only when money is involved.,"1.B
Whenever someone promises to do something in exchange for something. This exchange of money,
things, time, ideas, etc., is what distinguishes a contract from a gift. Promising to giv e something to
someone else is not a contract because no exchange occurs. Contracts can be binding whether or not
money is involved, or whether they are drawn up by a lawyer or private individuals.

Regulated by various laws. There are several laws that regulate the use of credit. T hese laws are
intended to guarantee that credit is managed fairly. The laws tend to improve the debtor-credi tor

Shift insurance costs to employees. Federal health insurance regulations attempt to protect consumers
by preventing employers from shifting too much of the costs of insurance to individual employees .
Without regulations, employers might not provide affordable insurance plans to employees. E mployers do

Finding an alternative resource. Businesses that choose not to use one resource to produce goods m ust 
find an alternative in order to continue. This often occurs when the price of a resource rises , causing the 
costs of production to increase. If a resource is scarce, users may conserve it by decreasing  the amount 
currently being utilized. The producer in this case is paying less for an alternative capital g ood, rather 
than trying to find another source at a better price.

refined in the region. Because it is the summer travel season, the demand for gasoline is increasing ; 
however, there is less gasoline available, and the prices for gasoline spike. What economic  condition 
does this situation best describe? 
",A. Scarcity,B. Conservation,C. Opportunity cost,D. Input maximization,"11. A 
Scarcity. Scarcity is a condition resulting from the gap between unlimited wa nt for goods (e.g., gasoline) 
and limited resources (e.g., oil). Because there is not enough of a resource (oil) to produce the de sired 
product (gasoline), supply declines. When demand for a product increases and supply for the product 
decreases, scarcity occurs. Exchange is the process of trading one good or service for something el se of 
value. Conservation is the preservation and protection of resources. Opportunity cost is the be nefit that a 
person loses when s/he decides to use scarce resources (e.g., money) for one purpose rather than for 
another. Inputs are the resources used in producing goods and services. When a business uses all of  the 
available inputs in the most efficient way to produce outputs, it is maximizing its inpu ts and outputs. 
Because there is a problem on the drilling platform, the inputs are not being used efficiently or to the best 
of their ability.

",A. dishonesty.,B. competition.,C. perishability.,D. management.,"13. B 
Competition. Business risk is the possibility of loss (failure) or gain (success) inherent in conducting 
business. There are several types of risks, including economic risks which are chances of  loss due to 
changes in the market. Competition is an example of one economic risk businesses face. For exam ple, a 
business that develops a unique product and begins to sell it in the marketplace may start out wi th a 
large part of the market share. As other companies develop similar products and start selling them, the 
business experiences more competition and usually starts losing market share. The busines s may try to 
improve the existing product or develop new products to gain back a portion of the market share. 
Perishability is a natural risk. Dishonesty is a human risk. Management consists of  people who make 
business decisions, which makes it a human risk, too.

",A. Demand-pull inflation,B. Cost-push inflation,C. Hyperinflation,D. Negative inflation,"14. C 
Hyperinflation. Hyperinflation —high and/or unexpected inflation —is harmful to the economy. It can 
restrict spending, discourage businesses from expanding, reduce the standard of living, and ev en cause 
shortages of goods. Demand-pull inflation is caused when the money supply grows faster than th e 
economy does. It is not necessarily harmful to the economy. Cost-push inflation occurs when limi ted 
commodities drive up costs and prices. It is not necessarily harmful to the economy, either. There is  no 
such thing as negative inflation. The opposite of inflation is deflation.

style involves a strong, “no -compromise” attitude. In a competitive negotiation, one or both parties view 
the situation as a rivalry or a game- like challenge. This style embraces the “I must win, so you  must lose” 
mentality. If using an avoidant style, a person does what s/he can to steer clear of an unc omfortable or

Spending patterns. A budget is an estimate of what income and expenses will be for a specific  time 
period. The expense section of a budget helps individuals review their spending patterns, which are the 
ways that they spend money. For example, a budget might indicate that a lot of money was bein g spent 
on convenience foods or casual clothing. This indicates a spending pattern that may need to b e changed 
depending on the amount of income. Developing a personal budget will not enable individual s to review 
their insurance policy coverage, investment plans, or bank statements.

",A. it is the easiest expense to cut from a budget.,B. it is not a necessary expense.,C. it is less costly than most other expenses.,D. the amount spent varies from month to month.,"31. D 
The amount spent varies from month to month. Variable expenses differ from fixed expenses bec ause 
fixed expenses are the same each month, whereas variable expenses change. Not all variable expenses  
are unnecessary. In addition, not all variable expenses are less costly and easy to cut. For example, 
grocery shopping is a variable expense, but it is also necessary, sometimes expensive, and n ot

$33,750. Calculating your net worth involves comparing your assets with your liabili ties (Assets - 
Liabilities = Net Worth). Your assets include savings accounts, cash savings, checking ac counts, stocks, 
and mutual funds. It also includes assets such as a home, car, boat, antiques, and jewelry. Your  liabilities 
don't take into account your annual expenses. For example, you would not include your monthly 
mortgage payment, your rent, or your utilities. Instead, you want to determine your outstanding  short to 
long-term debt. For example, if you have a credit card, and you pay it off each month, that's not g oing to 
be considered a liability, because each month that goes to zero. But if you have a stud ent loan that has 
an outstanding balance that you're paying off on a monthly basis over an extended period of time, then 
the balance due on that loan is a liability. Other examples of liabilities include t he balance due on a 
mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, a boat loan, and personal loans that you owe to others. Total the 
value of your assets, and then total the value of your liabilities. Subtract your liabi lities from your assets to 
determine your net worth. In this scenario, the total assets equal $71,500, while liabilities e qual $37,750. 
The difference between the two results in a net worth of $33,750. Utilities and monthly apartment rental 
are considered expenses, rather than liabilities and would not be included in the total for liabi lities.

Health insurance. Payroll deductions are monies that an employer withholds from an employee's gro ss 
earnings. A large portion of the deductions is the various income taxes, which the employer pays  to the 
government on behalf of the employee. Other deductions might include health insurance premiums, 
voluntary savings, and child-support payments. Net pay is the amount the employee  receives in his/her 
paycheck after the deductions have been subtracted from the gross earnings. Gross earnings are income 
before deductions. Overtime hours are the number of hours an employee works over his/her regular

Purchase. When individuals make investments, they receive purchase documents that include 
information about the cost of the investment and any commissions or fees that were paid. Individual s

good investment over a period of time. For example, the purchase record would indicate the cost 
(perhaps it was $25 a share), the total amount purchased (100 shares for a total of $2,500), and a fee of 
$30. By comparing the purchase records to actual value in five years, an individual will  be able to decide 
if the investment was worthwhile. Perhaps the cost per share is $40 a share in five years. An indiv idual

Pay off your balance each month. If you must use credit cards, the most effective way to avoid ex cessive 
credit card debt is to pay off your balance each month. By paying back what you've borrowed e ach 
month, you can avoid paying interest and other costly fees. If you cannot pay off your ba lance each 
month, work to pay off high-interest credit cards first, since high-interest credit cards cost yo u more in the 
long run than low-interest cards. Choose credit cards with low limits so that you have less of an 
opportunity to accumulate debt. Credit card cash advances usually result in extremely high inter est 
charges, often 20% or more. So, it is wise to avoid cash advances, rather than using them to pa y debt.

$29,770. To determine how much your investments will be worth in five years, calculate the f uture values 
of the investments. The formula used to find the future value of money is Future Value = Present Val ue X 
(1 + Interest Rate)Number of Years. So, the future value of your first investment is equal to $5,000 X (1 + 
0.06)5. To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.06 = 1.06). Next, raise this sum to 
the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.065 = 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 
1.06 X 1.06 = 1.3382). Finally, multiply this product by the original amount of the first investm ent to find 
its future value ($5,000 X 1.3382 = $6,691). Next, repeat the process for the second investment. Its 
future value is equal to $15,000 X (1 + 0. 09)5. First, add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.09 = 1.09). Then, 
raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself fiv e times (1.095 = 
1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 = 1.5386). Next, multiply this product by the original amount of the 
second investment to find its future value ($15,000 X 1.5386 = $23,079). Finally, add together the f uture

Think long term and be realistic about income and expenses. When taking on debt, you need to be 
honest about whether you will be able to repay the debt. You have to think about whether there are 
anticipated changes in your income and expenses over the life of the debt that would keep yo u from 
repaying it. Impulse buying creates unmanageable debt rather than avoids it. Debt payments m ust be 
made in a timely manner. If you anticipate that timely repayment will be a problem, don't con sider taking 
on additional debt. Although co-signers may be needed to obtain a loan, you should understand  that both

Having your children take out loans for college. Rather than using their retirement savings to pay  for 
college loans, parents should save what they can for their children's college fund, and then have their 
children take out loans to pay for the difference. Credit cards should not be used to pay for short-term

combat the risk of insurance fraud; rather, it penalizes someone who has already committed fr aud. It i s

making process. And, logic is a way to make sense of the facts —apart from personal or outside 
influence.

Marketing research. Employees who look for meaningful clues about what customers want and why th ey 
want it work in marketing research. Marketing research jobs focus on marketing activities that i nvolve 
determining information needs, designing data-collection processes, collecting data, analyzing  data, 
presenting data, and using data for marketing planning. These employees do not work in administrati ve 
services, securities and investments, or insurance. Employees working in administrative servi ces 
facilitate business operations through a variety of administrative and clerical duties, i ncluding information 
and communication management, data processing and collection, and project tracking. The securities 
and investments industry consists of brokerage firms, investment banks, and stock exchanges, all of  
which support the flow of funds from investors to companies and institutions. The insurance industry , 
which exists to protect individuals and businesses from financial losses, delivers  “products” that transfer 
risk from an individual or business to an insurance compan y.
