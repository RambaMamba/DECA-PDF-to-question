0,"1. Brix Beauty Salon used a celebrity's name and photograph in a recent newspaper advertisemen t, even 
though the celebrity had not given Brix permission to use her name and likeness. What tort di d Brix 
Beauty Salon commit? 
",A. Appropriation,B. Wrongful interference,C. Defamation,D. Conversion,"1. A 
Appropriation. Torts are civil wrongdoings that cause harm or injury to another party. Appropriati on, 
wrongful interference, defamation, and conversion are four kinds of torts. Appropriation, which Brix 
Beauty Salon committed, involves a business or person who uses —without permission —another 
person's name, likeness, and other unique characteristics for the benefit or gain of the user. Brix B eauty 
Salon used the celebrity's name and picture to attract customers to the salon. Unfortunately, Brix ha d not 
obtained permission to use the celebrity's name or likeness. As a result, the celebrit y could sue Brix for 
appropriation. Wrongful interference consists of predatory behavior undertaken by a business to draw 
either customers or employees away from a competitor. Defamation involves making false, mali cious 
statements about a person or organization. Conversion occurs when personal property is taken f rom the 
owner and given to someone else to use.

Antitrust. A tying agreement is an illegal arrangement that occurs when a business requires a  customer 
to buy other products in order to obtain the goods and services that the customer really wants. To protect 
individuals and businesses, many governments develop regulations known as antitrust la ws that protect 
individuals and businesses from unfair practices that restrain trade and competiti on. Probate laws involve

become an ethical issue if it 
",A. eliminates tax incentives.,B. encourages economic growth.,C. reduces competition.,D. supports competing agreements.,"5. C 
Reduces competition. Some businesses charge their vendors slotting fees to acquire retail s helf space. 
The purpose of a slotting fee is to cover expenses (e.g., labor, pricing) associated with carry ing the 
product. Because slotting fees can be very expensive, small vendors with limited financ ial resources 
often cannot afford to pay slotting fees, which can limit or reduce competition. Activit ies that inhibit 
competition and support monopolies are unethical and in many situations, illegal. Slotti ng fees do not 
encourage economic growth, eliminate tax incentives, or support competing agreements.

Over-commitment can lead to a lower quality of work. It is important for workers to assess the ti me

activities (over-commitment), they often find that they don't have enough time to complete  the projects 
thoroughly and correctly, which affects the quality of the work. Dillon may not have the autho rity to 
delegate work to other employees. Managers often notice, appreciate, and acknowledge the emplo yees 
who accept additional responsibilities and produce quality work; however, these cir cumstances do not 
ensure that the employees will be promoted. When an employee takes on too many activities, starting

Open-ended. Researchers assign codes to survey responses in an effort to use the information in a 
numerical mode. Open-ended questions are designed so that respondents react to questions in a 
manner that requires more than ""yes"" or ""no"" as an answer. Because possible responses are not 
controlled or limited, coding is often more difficult. Closed-end questions offer limited response option s to 
inquiries or statements. Force-choice questions are closed-end questions. A scale is a method  of 
measurement that assigns range of possible responses. For example, a scale that is often used to 
assess a respondent's feeling regarding a statement might range from ""strongly agree"" to ""stro ngly

Logistics. Operations are the day- to-day activities for continued business functioning. Logistics refers to 
the function of operations that manages the flow of goods and services from production to consumption. 
Logistics includes all the people, information, and processes involved in storing (e.g., type of  warehouse) 
and transporting goods (e.g., shipping method). Scheduling is the production activity that establishes the 
timetable to be followed in production. Maintenance needs refer to the routine maintenance and repair of 
business facilities and equipment. The operations function controls many activities withi n the business, 
which means that this function encounters a lot of expenses incurred by the business. Therefore, 
expense control is an important operations activity because it focuses on efficiency and keepi ng the 
business's costs low for its day- to-day activities.

",A. Increased risk of theft,B. Increased accident rates,C. Decreased financial losses,D. Decreased counterfeiting activity,"65. A 
Increased risk of theft. Businesses establish different types of security procedures to protect their 
assets —equipment, inventory, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to 
communicate these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to 
maintain a secure work environment. If employees do not follow security procedures, the risk of security 
breaches occurring increases. For example, an employee who does not properly lock the cash drawer 
increases the risk of robbery. If employees fail to lock the warehouse doors at the end of bus iness hours, 
the risk of theft increases. If a security breach occurs, the business may experience financial l osses (e.g., 
stolen money, goods, and equipment). Employees follow safety procedures to reduce the risk of  
accidents in the workplace. Financial losses may decrease if businesses train their emplo yees to identify 
counterfeit paper money at the point of sale.

against the 
",A. ordering costs.,B. selling price.,C. fixed expenses.,D. interest rates.,"68. A 
Ordering costs. Ordering costs are the expenses that retailers incur to buy merchandise. The price they 
pay for the items, shipping charges, taxes, personnel salaries, and some operational expenses (e .g., 
telephone charges) might be considered when determining the ordering costs. Ordering costs are often 
compared to the cost of warehousing the product for a certain period of time. When warehousing costs 
are less than ordering costs, retailers generally reorder more products on a less frequent basis. The 
selling price is the price that the end user pays for an item. Fixed expenses refers to the payables that 
remain the same for a set period of time. Insurance and rent are examples of a business's fixed 
expenses. Interest is defined as the money payments for the use of borrowed money. The inter est rate is 
the percentage figure used in calculating interest charges for a loan.

convince the business to produce or provide the product for these customers. By offering a new product 
that many customers want, the business can increase its sales and profits. Salespeople do not esta blish 
trends. Listening to customers' feedback does not always encourage a salesperson to reorganize his /her 
personal priorities. The purchasing department usually orders inventory for the business.

respond by placing an order. Customers who receive samples and cents-off coupons often use the 
coupons to buy the products. Businesses benefit by increasing their sales volume. Direc t-response

95,"96. Providing quality customer service on a consistent basis often helps salespeople increas e sales to 
",A. new prospects.,B. first-time buyers.,C. current customers.,D. major corporations.,"96. C 
Current customers. Salespeople often try to increase sales to current customers by providing qualit y 
service on a consistent basis. Current customers who are satisfied with the level of service often  become 
lifetime customers and buy additional goods and services. Salespeople realize that it may be  easier to 
sell more to current customers than to identify new customers. However, current customers probably will 
not buy more if they are not satisfied with the service. New prospects are potential customers —ones who 
might buy. First-time buyers are those who are buying from a salesperson for the first time and who do 
not yet know what type of service they will receive. Providing quality customer servic e on a consistent 
basis might increase sales to major corporations if those corporations are also current customers rather 
than new prospects or first-time buyers.

96,"97. To avoid legal problems, a salesperson must be careful when telling customers about products so that 
customers don't confuse the salesperson's opinion statements with 
",A. skills.,B. facts.,C. incompetence.,D. indifference.,"97. B 
Facts. Facts are true statements. During the selling process, a salesperson must carefully communicate 
product information to customers, so that the customers do not confuse the facts about a product with the 
salesperson's opinion. For example, when a salesperson says, ""This product is the best item on  the 
market,"" s/he is expressing an opinion rather than stating a fact. If a customer purchases the product on 
the basis of this statement, and finds that the item does not work properly, the salesperson and the 
business might be liable for misrepresenting the product. Skills are abilities to perform task s that are 
developed through knowledge, training, and practice. Incompetence is inability to do a task c orrectly, and 
indifference is an attitude.
