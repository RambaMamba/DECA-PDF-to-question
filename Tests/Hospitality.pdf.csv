industry to take 
",A. total responsibility for accidents.,B. no risks.,C. insurance out of each customer.,D. reasonable care.,"3. D 
Reasonable care. When hospitality and tourism businesses act in a way that a reasonable hospital ity and 
tourism business would have acted, the business exhibits reasonable care. If hospital ity and tourism 
businesses can prove that they acted with reasonable care, they are not fined by the courts. Oth erwise, 
the courts can find them guilty of negligence, and they would be charged a fine. It's not possibl e for 
hospitality and tourism businesses to avoid all risks. There is always the chance t hat something bad can 
happen. Hospitality and tourism businesses are not insurers of their customers nor do they take out 
insurance on each customer. Instead, they take out liability insurance that transfers risk to an insurance 
company. Hospitality and tourism businesses act so that they limit their responsibi lity for accidents.

Implement innovative management practices. Many employees are in direct contact with customers, s o 
they learn what the customers need and want. When employees are encouraged to exchange ideas and 
to “think outside the box,” the business is supporting an innovative management style. When an 
innovative, creative environment is fostered, employees are willing to present their ideas for ne w

changing markets and help it thrive in the marketplace. Developing licensing programs and busines s

of business and the business's goals. All businesses should review their profit margins  on a regular 
basis, regardless of their willingness to develop new products. Laissez-faire managers assum e little or no

",A. Long -term government projects are easier to arrange.,B. Wealth is redistributed in a way that is often productive to the economy.,C. It becomes difficult for consumers to plan ahead.,D. Businesses often hire more employees.,"27. C 
It becomes difficult for consumers to plan ahead. If there is no inflation or deflation, prices in the econ omy 
stay mostly constant. This is known as price stability. When prices are instable, it becomes di fficult for 
consumers to plan ahead. How can consumers budget for major purchases when they can't predict 
prices? While price instability often causes the redistribution of wealth, this isn't usual ly good for the 
economy. Long-term government projects aren't easier to arrange when there is price instability —in fact, 
price instability makes it much more difficult for governments to plan. Just as consumers have a hard 
time committing to big financial plans during economic uncertainty, the government finds it dif ficult to plan 
large projects when prices fluctuate. Price instability does not cause businesses to hire more employees; 
in fact, price instability typically discourages  businesses from taking on costly expenditures like hiring 
new people.

Virtual private network. Software refers to the programs that instruct computers to perform specific 
operations. Software that instructs the computer to transfer certain information to specific computer 
systems through a secure Internet exchange is a virtual private network (VPN). When cha nnel members'

Protecting consumer privacy. Businesses are becoming more concerned with ways of protecting 
consumer privacy because of the new technology that makes it easy to gather and disseminate per sonal 
information. The rapid growth of electronic commerce, which enables consumers to purchase products 
online, also enables businesses to collect information about credit cards, personal preferences, and 
buying habits that many consumers prefer to keep private. In response to a growing concern on the part 
of consumers, businesses are trying to develop techniques that will protect consumer privacy —not only 
online —but also from other types of abuses. Economic expansion and marketing research are 
fundamental business activities rather than current trends. Private enterprise is an economic sy stem in

Price. As more hotels enter the hospitality marketplace, competitors are looking for ways to kee p their

many hotels are emphasizing price by offering deep discounts and special packages that focus on pri ce. 
Place is an element of marketing that focuses on considerations in getting a selected product  in the right

Comparing project standards with actual performance. Standards are specifications or statements that

basis for evaluating project results. For example, a project manager might compare the budget allocated 
for a specific phase of the project with the actual amount of money spent during that phase to ev aluate 
the use of financial resources. Project managers set goals at the beginning of a project. Project 
managers must obtain a variety of project data (e.g., internal and external) before they can evaluate 
project results; therefore, conducting data searches is not a method of evaluating project results. Projec t

Monitor and control expenses. An invoice (bill) documents how much a customer or client owes for the 
goods or services a business provides. To operate, a business orders office supplies, outsources

state how much the business owes. The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is  
billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the b usiness will 
likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments. Tracking invoices is one way the business

A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available,D. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available,"88. C 
A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decreas e in the 
number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend th eir 
discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of room s available as 
more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the 
number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests  that as 
demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and  a 
decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes d own, 
the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests  and a 
decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic tim es when people are 
more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel.

recipient. Hotels/Motels are interested in building a clientele of satisfied guests, but they  are also 
interested in attracting new guests who have not previously used the facilities.
