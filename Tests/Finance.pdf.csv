",A. moral conduct.,B. ethical behavior.,C. conservation.,D. industrialization.,"3. C
Conservation. Many nations have developed environmental regulations to conserve their natural
resources by requiring businesses to control pollution, dispose of hazardous waste p roperly, and use
nonrenewable resources wisely. These regulations set pollution standards that businesses must m eet,
establish rules for disposing of waste, encourage recycling, and monitor illegal dumping. Nation s realize
that natural resources are limited and must be conserved or renewed in order to be available for future
generations. Nations did not develop environmental regulations to encourage ethical behavi or or moral
conduct, although some environmental regulations deal with ethical and moral issues. Industri alization is
the changeover from producing goods by hand labor to the use of machines and the organization of such
production into industries.

Claiming the loss as a tax deduction. The difference between the cost of an investment and the sel ling 
price of that same investment is either a capital gain or capital loss. The federal government taxes th e 
capital gains on investments. If an investment suffers a loss in value in relation to its purc hase price, the 
government allows the owner to claim the loss as a tax deduction. Liquidating remaining assets, 
obtaining a loan, and renegotiating lower insurance premiums may provide the investor  with needed cash 
or savings, but these actions do not change or minimize the monetary loss on the investment p roperty.

",A. Progressive,B. Regressive,C. Proportional,D. Exclusive,"22. A 
Progressive. Gary favors a progressive tax structure. A progressive tax structure is one in which those 
who earn more are required to pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. In other words, as the 
income increases, the tax rate also increases. The U.S. income tax is a progressive tax. If using a 
regressive tax structure, people who earn more income pay a lower percentage of income in taxes.  As 
income increases, the tax rate decreases.  Sales and excise taxes are considered to be regressive taxes, 
because people with lower incomes ultimately pay a larger percentage of their income i n sales and 
excise taxes. A proportional tax structure is one in which everyone pays the same percentage of i ncome 
in taxes, regardless of income level.  Few taxes are completely proportional in nature. Exclusive is not a

Output decreases. Interest is the money payments for the use of borrowed money. Payment amou nts 
vary when interest rates change. When interest rates rise, the economy often experiences a declin e in 
consumer demand, in consumer spending, in job growth, and in output. Output refers to the goods and 
services produced as the result of combining inputs —an output is a product available for sale. Output 
decreases because product demand and consumer spending decrease when interest rates rise. High 
interest rates do not necessarily result in higher profits for businesses or mean that the costs of goods 
decrease.

One-stop shopping environment for consumers. Convergence, which is the merging of financial prov iders

having to go to different financial providers for different financial products and services, customers c an

convergence and consolidation have created finance companies that want to be everything t o everybody. 
Rather than specializing in any one service, many of today's financial firms offer a vast ar ray of products 
and services. As financial firms merge and grow in size, it becomes more difficult for fina ncial experts and 
the government to get an accurate picture of the firms' current financial condition. As finance corporati ons

",A. Interest rates fluctuate daily.,B. Business expansion slows quickly.,C. Unemployment rates stabilize steadily.,D. Consumer spending increases consistently.,"44. B 
Business expansion slows quickly. Slower business expansion is one factor that indi cates an economic 
recession. When business productivity slows, there is less work for laborers. When there i s less work for 
laborers, businesses tend to lay off employees, causing unemployment rates to rise. Unemplo yment 
leads to less consumer spending because the displaced workers do not have income available t o buy 
goods and services, including financial products. Fluctuating interest rates do not always indic ate

Make informed decisions. Managerial or cost accounting involves obtaining and analyzing d ata about a

overhead is higher than expected for a specific time period. The appropriate employees can use the

increase efficiency). Businesses can monitor external factors, but cannot control them. O btaining a loan 
might be a decision that a business makes as a result of the managerial accounting information  it

Sustainability report. Sustainability reporting looks beyond the business's fina ncial data and summarizes 
its position in terms of social responsibility —its governance practices, commitment to stakeholders, and 
the economic effect on the natural environment and community at large. A business that uses al l of its 
resources responsibly and has a positive effect on the external environment is more likely  to be 
sustainable —in a position to continue operating long-term. Existing and potential stakeholders often 
review a business's sustainability report when making investment decisions because t hey do not want to 
invest in a company that is not sustainable. A mission statement is a brief summary of what the  business 
owner wants a business to be doing —it defines the business's overall purpose. An executive summary is 
the component of a complex report that summarizes the key points of the entire document. An action 
plan documents the methods in which a business will carry out a project or activity.

Visit the bank's website. Because many businesses post and update product information on the ir 
websites, their customers can access information they need 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Many  
customers obtain product information from websites because it is quick, convenient, accurate, and 
secure. A bank's financial officer does not usually take routine customer-service calls and may not b e 
available to take a customer's call. Customers usually do not need to make appointments with bank

Contracting with an insurer with a reputation of adequate claims reserving,D. Questioning a supplier's history of disobeying state and federal regulations,"95. A 
Understanding loss experience and exposure to an insurance underwriter. Ethical behavior and r isk 
management are closely related. Unethical behavior can expose a company to a variety of different ri sks. 
To manage these risks, a risk manager must exercise ethical behavior and expect it of other empl oyees 
within the company as well. A wide range of internal ethical hazards arise when working with an 
insurance company. If the risk manager understates the company's loss experience or loss exposure to 
an insurance underwriter to reduce the company's insurance premium, s/he exposes the company to 
legal and financial risks. A risk manager can reduce his/her company's exposure to risk  by working with a 
public accounting firm that has a whistleblower mechanism, contracting with an insurer with a reputa tion 
of adequate claims reserving, and questioning a supplier's history of disobeying state and fed eral 
regulations.

bottle's label and exterior packaging. By disclosing this information, the company is reduci ng risks 
associated with 
",A. product returns.,B. mechanical product defects.,C. product recalls.,D. inadequate product warnings.,"97. D 
Inadequate product warnings. Though specifications vary by product type, businesses must pr ovide 
adequate information about their products. For example, pharmaceutical companies must advise 
consumers about a medication's dosage, ingredients, side effects, and possible negative inter actions 
with food, other medications, alcohol, etc. Businesses that do not appropriately label their  products 
increase their risks of lawsuits in relation to inadequate product warnings. Medicati ons are not 
mechanical in nature. Product recalls occur when quality issues are detected after the products are 
released for sale. When this occurs, businesses take steps to retrieve those goods to reduce the 
consumers' exposure to safety risks. A product return is the process by which buyers return defective or 
unwanted good to the seller.

company using to combat the internal threat of fire: 
",A. Loss avoidance,B. Loss reduction,C. Loss prevention,D. Risk transfer,"98. B 
Loss reduction. Loss reduction is a form of risk control. Risk control methods are used to r educe or 
minimize loss. Loss reduction lessens the impact of a loss after it occurs. For instance, alth ough the 
automatic sprinklers won't prevent a fire from starting, they will lessen the impact that the fire h as on the 
company's buildings. Companies utilize loss avoidance when they choose not to tak e part in risky 
activity. Loss prevention focuses on stopping certain losses from occurring. Companies transfer risk  by 
purchasing insurance and entering into contracts that transfer the risk to others.
