0,"1. Margo signed a lease to rent a small building for her business. In exchange for the use of the facilit y, 
Margo will pay monthly rent. What component of a legally binding contract does the rent re present? 
",A. Competent parties,B. Consideration,C. Legality,D. Agreement,"1. B 
Consideration. In order for a contract to be legally binding, something of value must be exchanged. In this 
case, the rent is being exchanged for space. Agreement requires an offer be made by one party and 
accepted by the second party. Competent parties require those entering a contract to be of legal age a nd 
to meet other criteria. Legality refers to the terms of the offer being within the law. 
"
1,"2. An offer must be made by one party and accepted by the other party in order for a contract to be  
",A. put in written form.,B. notarized.,C. legally binding.,D. interpreted correctly.,"2. C 
Legally binding. In order for a contract to be legally binding, an offer must be made by one party and 
accepted by the other party. In effect, the two parties are agreeing to the terms stated in the contract. 
Then, both parties must live up to those terms. All contracts do not need to be notarized, put in written 
form, or interpreted correctly. 
"
2,"3. Which of the following is an example of involuntary debt: 
",A. Unsecured line of credit,B. Automobile loan,C. Fixed-rate mortgage,D. Court judgment lien,"3. D 
Court judgment lien. A debtor-creditor relationship can be based on two different types of debt —voluntary 
and involuntary. Voluntary debt includes any debt that a person or business willingl y creates. Examples 
include automobile loans, mortgages, and lines of credit. Involuntary debt is debt that a person  or 
business does not ask for nor willingly assume. For example, if a court of law finds a business  liable for a 
customer's injuries resulting from a fall on the business's premises, the court may place a j udgment lien 
on the business's property to ensure that the business compensates the customer for her/his injuries. 
The business doesn't want to take on the debt; instead, the court determines that the business owes the 
customer money and requires the business to pay the debt. The lien is an involuntary  debt for the 
business. 
"
3,"4. A ""spoof,"" or a fake email that appears real, is part of what investment scam? 
",A. Pump and dump,B. A pyramid scheme,C. Affinity fraud,D. Phishing,"4. D 
Phishing. A ""spoof,"" or a fake email that appears real, is part of the investment scam called phi shing. 
Phishing is an online identity-theft scam that fools its victims into believing  they are submitting sensitive, 
personal information (such as credit card numbers or bank passwords) to a legitimate website. A p yramid 
scheme is an investment scam based on a hierarchy in which the scammers lure in inv estors, who must 
then recruit new investors, and so on. Each level gives some of its returns to the level abo ve it. Affinity 
fraud is when someone fraudulently claims to be a member of the same ethnic, religious, c areer, or 
community group in order to gain a potential investor's trust. Pump and dump is an investment scam  that 
involves hyping up small, unheard-of stocks. Usually over the Internet, the scammers con uns uspecting 
investors into buying the stock so its price will go up. Then, the scammers sell out at the high  price, 
leaving the other investors to deal with the inevitable price plummet. 
"
4,"5. Which of the following is an example of a regulation that protects investors: 
",A. Brokerage firms are required to abide by equal opportunity employment laws.,B. Individuals are not allowed to purchase and sell more than five stocks per week.,C. Companies must honestly and publicly disclose their business information.,D. Newspapers and magazines are not allowed to report on stock market trends.,"5. C 
Companies must honestly and publicly disclose their business information. To protect in vestors from 
unethical trading activity, government agencies create and enforce laws that securities and  investment 
firms must adhere to. One regulation intended to protect investors is the requirement for companies to  
honestly and publicly disclose their financial information. This requirement prote cts individuals from 
investing in a company that claims it is financially healthier than it truly is. Individ uals are not limited to 
buying and selling five stocks per week. Like all companies, brokerage firms must abide by equal 
opportunity employment laws —but these laws do not specifically protect investors. Newspapers and 
magazines are not prohibited from reporting on stock market trends. 
"
5,"6. When providing services to clients, financial professionals have the responsibility to supply 
",A. accurate information.,B. payment options.,C. credit counseling.,D. bank statements.,"6. A 
Accurate information. Financial professionals often invest money for clients. As a result, they shou ld 
provide clients with accurate information about the performance of possible investments. Some 
investments are more secure than others. Those clients who do not want to take risks should know w hich 
investment options are the safest. Financial professionals have this information and should supp ly it to 
clients. Financial professionals do not necessarily offer payment options. Not all financial profes sionals 
supply credit counseling. Financial professionals usually do not supply clients with ba nk statements.  
"
6,"7. What should you do if a financial client reports a problem with her/his portfolio? 
",A. Call the client back later after s/he has calmed down.,B. Apologize and resolve the problem immediately.,C. Ask the manager to return the client's call.,D. Waive the client's fees for his/her next five transactions.,"7. B 
Apologize and resolve the problem immediately. Finance professionals are most likely to buil d customer 
loyalty and retention if they resolve any client problems and complaints as soon as poss ible. Waiting until 
later to deal with the problem is unwise; while waiting for a call back, the client may become even more 
upset than s/he already is. Before involving a manager, finance professionals should attempt to resolve 
their clients' problems themselves. While waiving the client's fees for future transactions  can benefit the 
client, doing so doesn't necessarily resolve the client's problem. 
"
7,"8. Which of the following is typically an effective method to build trusting relationships  with financial clients: 
",A. Contacting clients only when problems arise with their accounts,B. Using precise technical language when explaining financial products,C. Asking others in the organization to follow up after sales transactions,D. Explaining the benefits and drawbacks of different financial products,"8. D 
Explaining the benefits and drawbacks of different financial products. One responsibility tha t finance 
professionals have is to provide complete product information to clients. This means explaining  the 
benefits as well as the drawbacks of different financial products so that clients can make educated 
decisions about what to do with their money. When finance professionals communicate openly , their 
clients are much more likely to trust them. And, when clients trust their finance professionals, t hey are 
more likely to become loyal and satisfied customers. Rather than using precise technical la nguage and 
financial jargon, finance professionals can build more trust by talking to their clien ts in language that the 
clients understand. Rather than asking others in the organization to follow up after sales transac tions, 
finance professionals can build trusting relationships with clients by following up with them themselves. 
Although some clients may only want to be contacted when problems arise, most clients prefer to stay  in 
communication with their finance professionals on a more regular basis. 
"
8,"9. The inputs that allow businesses to operate are called economic 
",A. incentives.,B. services.,C. models.,D. resources.,"9. D 
Resources. Economic resources are the natural and human resources and capital goods used to 
produce goods and services. Economic incentives are the monetary motivations for engaging in 
economic activity. An economic model serves to illustrate a point about economic happeni ngs. 
"
9,"10.  One of the main reasons why individuals make investments based on their future financ ial needs is to 
",A. develop a living will.,B. avoid paying taxes.,C. set up a trust fund.,D. generate retirement income.,"10. D 
Generate retirement income. Most individuals analyze their future financial needs in orde r to make 
investments that will generate income in the future. The reason for the investments is to have income to 
support them during retirement. Individuals estimate future living expenses and mak e investments in the 
hope of generating adequate retirement income. Individuals do not make investments based on their 
future financial needs to avoid paying taxes, set up a trust fund, or develop a living will. 
"
10,"11. What economic activity examines how money payments are divided between resource owners an d 
producers? 
",A. Production,B. Consumption,C. Exchange,D. Distribution,"11. D 
Distribution. This economic activity examines how the money payments received by res ource owners and 
producers are divided or distributed. Resource owners must feel that the incomes they receive are large 
enough so that they will continue to be willing to supply resources. Producers must rec eive enough 
income so that they are able to continue making or providing goods and services. Consumption is the 
process or activity of using goods and services. Production is the making of goods and servi ces. 
Exchange involves the exchange of money payments between producers and the owners of resour ces. 
"
11,"12. John gets up, dresses, brushes his teeth, eats breakfast, goes to school, buys gum at the school s tore, 
and reports to his first class. Which of these would be considered an economic activity ? 
",A. Brushing teeth,B. Eating breakfast,C. Buying gum,D. Going to class,"12. C 
Buying gum. This activity involves the exchange of two things of monetary value, gu m and money. 
Economic activities involve consumption, production, exchange, and distribution. The  other alternatives 
are noneconomic activities. 
"
12,"13. The main reason people are willing to face possible business risks is 
",A. jobs.,B. profit.,C. power.,D. security.,"13. B 
Profit. In our private enterprise economic system, we have the right to take risks. The main reas on people 
are willing to face business risk is that they hope to make a profit. Jobs, power, and security may be 
contributing reasons for people to go into business for themselves, but they are not as compelling as 
profit. 
"
13,"14. Some businesses are able to avoid potential risks by taking actions to __________ them. 
",A. eliminate,B. overlook,C. examine,D. disregard,"14. A 
Eliminate. A business risk can sometimes be recognized and then eliminated completel y. For example, 
the risk to a business of losing key personnel in an airplane crash can be eliminate d by not allowing them 
to fly. Businesses examine, or study, their potential risks, but they do not intentionally  disregard or 
overlook potential risks that may be harmful or costly. 
"
14,"15. When a nation's inflation rate is low, what do prices tend to do? 
",A. Fluctuate daily,B. Increase dramatically,C. Remain stable,D. Reduce currency values,"15. C 
Remain stable. Inflation is a rapid rise in prices that may occur when demand exceeds supply or when 
productivity declines and costs of labor go up. Generally, low inflation rates range bet ween 1% and 4%, 
which indicates a strong economy and stable prices. Although some products' prices fluctuate on  a daily 
basis (e.g., gasoline), not all prices do. High inflation causes a decrease in the value of a nation's 
currency. 
"
15,"16. Which of the following statements is true about inflation: 
",A. It increases when the money supply decreases.,B. It has little effect on consumers' ability to save.,C. It is usually caused by a supply surplus.,D. It decreases the value of money.,"16. D 
It decreases the value of money. Inflation is a rise in prices. When there is a rapid ris e in prices, it takes 
more money to buy the same item. When this occurs, individuals and businesses buy less wi th the same 
amount of money —the value of money decreases. Inflation can occur when there is an increase in the 
money supply or when the availability of an item drops, but the demand remains the same or inc reases. 
When prices increase, individuals and businesses often have less money to save and inves t. 
"
16,"17. When two parties work together to negotiate a result that is mutually beneficial, it i s called a __________ 
outcome.  
",A. lose-lose,B. win-lose,C. win-win,D. lose-win,"17. C 
Win-win. When people collaborate, they work together. A collaborative negotiating style is most likely to 
create an outcome that benefits both parties. It builds lasting relationships by embracing an ""ev erybody 
wins"" attitude. Use of the accommodating negotiating style often results in a lose-win outc ome. The 
combative and competitive negotiating styles are based on a win-lose attitude. Lose-los e outcomes most 
often occur when using the avoidance negotiating strategy. 
"
17,"18. Which of the following is a disadvantage of using cash as a form of financial exchang e: 
",A. The risk of theft decreases.,B. Cash payments often incur fees.,C. There is a higher risk of fraud.,D. It is easy to steal or lose.,"18. D 
It is easy to steal or lose. Cash, more so than other forms of financial exchange, is easy to steal or l ose.

fees the way that some other forms of payment sometimes do. There is a relatively low ri sk of fraud with 
cash.

"
19,"20. Marshall's employer pays him for the work that he performs while on the job. This is an exam ple of 
",A. passive revenue.,B. earned income.,C. capital gains.,D. transfer payments.,"20. B 
Earned income. Income is money that individuals and businesses receive from other sources. M arshall 
worked to receive wages from his employer, so he has earned income. Unearned income is revenue that 
individuals and businesses passively obtain. In these situations, individual s or businesses do not actually 
perform work to obtain the money. Dividends, rent, and transfer payments are examples of unearned 
income. Transfer payments are monies paid by the government for which no goods or services are 
received in exchange, such as welfare benefits, veterans' benefits, disaster aid, and unemploymen t. A 
capital gain refers to the amount of increase in value of an asset in relation to its price at the time o f 
purchase. 
"
20,"21. What is a primary consideration when evaluating the time value of money? 
",A. Tariffs,B. Premiums,C. Credit limit,D. Interest rate,"21. D 
Interest rate. The time value of money is the difference between the money's current purchasing power i n 
relation to its purchasing power at a future date. For example, when people place their money in a 
savings account, they earn interest on the amount (principal) that they put into the acc ount. If bank A 
pays a higher interest rate than bank B, an individual's principal will be worth more in the future by  
placing it in bank A. Premiums are free items that businesses offer to buyers of particular products. A 
credit limit is the maximum amount of money that can be owed on a credit account. Tariffs  or duties are 
taxes on imported goods. 
"
21,"22. The arrangement by which businesses or individuals can purchase now and pay later is  known as 
",A. credit.,B. capacity.,C. interest.,D. collateral.,"22. A 
Credit. Businesses use credit to obtain goods and services to sell, and consumers use credit to purcha se 
those goods and services. Interest is the fee that lenders charge borrowers for the use of cred it. Capacity 
is the individual's ability to earn income, one of the three C's of credit. Collateral is any thing of value 
belonging to the borrower which is pledged to the lender to guarantee that the loan will be r epaid. 
"
22,"23. Which of the following is a type of credit card that can be used to make purchases from a variet y of 
participating businesses: 
",A. Hotel,B. Retail store,C. Bank,D. Petroleum,"23. C

cardholders a wide range of businesses from which to choose. Retail store, hotel, and petroleum c ards 
are issued by individual companies and may be used only at their facilities. 
"
23,"24. If you purchase a car, which type of credit are you most likely to use? 
",A. Regular,B. Installment,C. Budget,D. Revolving,"24. B 
Installment. Installment credit is commonly used to purchase large, expensive items such as  cars. The 
title for an item purchased on installment credit is made out in the name of the credit user; however, the 
seller retains a claim on the title until all of the payments have been made. Regular credit a ccounts are 
used to obtain small-ticket items during a set period of time, usually 30 days. Budget c redit accounts 
advertise credit terms such as ""90 Days Same as Cash."" Revolving credit accounts involve setti ng a 
credit limit and paying the amount due each month or making minimum, monthly paymen ts on the 
account. 
"
24,"25. Jordan buys a sofa from a local furniture store that advertises ""90 days same as cash."" She's able t o 
have the sofa delivered to her house immediately without paying anything. However, i f she doesn't pay 
for the sofa within the 90-day period, she'll be subject to finance charges. Jordan bought the  sofa using a 
__________ credit account. 
",A. revolving,B. budget,C. regular,D. installment,"25. B 
Budget. Budget accounts are often used by furniture or appliance retailers as a form of short-term  
credit —for example, ""90 days same as cash"" means that customers can purchase goods on credit with 
the same advantages they would have with cash purchases. Budget accounts do not charge interest if 
the user makes payments on time. However, if a customer doesn't pay the amount in full by the end of 
the 90 days, s/he is subject to finance charges applying to the full time period. In revolvin g credit 
accounts, the maximum amount of money that the credit user can owe (also known as the credit limi t) is 
set at the time the credit account is opened. Regular credit accounts are also known as open credit 
accounts because they allow credit users to buy at any time during a set period. At the end of that time, 
the person or business is expected to pay the entire amount that is due for the purchases made d uring 
that period. An installment credit account is designed to handle one credit transaction, w hich is paid in 
installments within a certain time period. The credit user makes a down payment and signs  an agreement 
to pay monthly installments until the total is paid. 
"
25,"26. Which of the following statements about retirement is true: 
",A. You will be in retirement only about 15 years.,B. You have plenty of time to start saving for retirement.,C. You can depend on Social Security for your basic living expenses.,D. Saving even a little bit each month will help.,"26. D 
Saving even a little bit each month will help. Even a small amount of money, invested from an  early age 
over a long period of time, can make a significant contribution to retirement savings. P eople do not have 
plenty of time to save for retirement; beginning early allows more time for savings to grow. Soci al 
Security benefits are not likely to cover basic living expenses. Due to longer life spans , many people are 
in retirement longer than 15 years. 
"
26,"27. When there is not enough of a resource available for everyone to have as much of it as desired , the 
resource is 
",A. natural.,B. unlimited.,C. limited.,D. human.,"27. C 
Limited.  Limited resources occur when not enough of them are available for everyone to have as much 
as they desire. An unlimited resource is available to everyone in any quantity des ired. A natural resource 
is a resource found in nature. A human resource is a person who works to provide goods and servi ces.    
"
27,"28. One advantage to setting attainable goals is that you 
",A. work harder to achieve a very high goal.,B. can measure your progress.,C. are less likely to become discouraged.,D. can picture it in your mi nd.,"28. C 
Are less likely to become discouraged. Attainable goals are realistic and within re ach, so one advantage 
to setting attainable goals is that you are less likely to become discouraged. Attainabl e goals will not 
make you work harder to achieve a very high goal —very high goals do not fit the definition of attainable. 
Being able to picture a goal in your mind is the result of setting a specific goal, not necess arily an 
attainable one. Being able to measure your progress is the result of setting a measurable goal, also no t 
necessarily an attainable one. 
"
28,"29. Scarlet is setting her personal financial goals. What is the first step she should take to reaching her 
financial goals? 
",A. Automate payments,B. Prioritize her goals,C. Evaluate her budget,D. Make a list of her goals,"29. D 
Make a list of her goals. The first step to achieving financial goals is identifying t he goals and making a 
list. Prioritizing financial goals comes after making a list of goals. After listi ng her goals and organizing 
them by importance, Scarlet will want to evaluate her budget and automate as many payments as  
possible. 
"
29,"30. Fayth is developing her personal budget. She intends to save 10% of her income, use 38% of her i ncome 
for housing and utilities, spend 14% on food, devote 20% to transportation, and set aside the rest for 
clothing, recreation, and entertainment. She earns $958 per pay period. How much money does she pl an 
to spend on clothing, recreation, and entertainment each pay period? 
",A. $306.56,B. $134.12,C. $288.34,D. $172.44,"30. D 
$172.44. To calculate how much money Fayth has budgeted for clothing, recreation, and entert ainment, 
first add together the portions of her income that she plans to use for everything else (10% + 38% + 14% 
+ 20% = 82%). She plans to devote 82% of her income to savings, housing and utilities, food, an d 
transportation. Since she wants to set the rest of her pay aside for clothing, recreation, and 
entertainment, subtract the percentage of her income spent on everything else from 100% (100 - 82 =  
18%). Finally, multiply her income per pay period by 18% to find how much money she plans  to spend on 
clothing, recreation, and entertainment ($958 X 18% = $172.44). 
"
30,"31. Which of the following is a strategy to help with tracking expenses: 
",A. Estimate fixed expenses.,B. Only use cash payments.,C. Spend as little as possible.,D. Keep receipts.,"31. D 
Keep receipts. When tracking expenses, it is important to use receipts as a record of spending in order 
for your budget to be accurate. Only using cash payments will not help you track expenses; ac tually, 
cash transactions are more difficult to track. Spending as little as possible will help y ou save money but 
will not necessarily make it easier to track expenses. Finally, fixed expenses are the same each mon th, 
so they generally do not have to be estimated.

31,"32. Zach invested $300 in the stock market. With the stock market's average yearly gain of 10 pe rcent, his 
original $300 grew to $330 after one year. In two years' time, his $300 became $363. The year after that, 
his original investment had become $399. Zach's investment grew as a result of 
",A. globalization.,B. opportunity cost.,C. banking services.,D. compounding.,"32. D 
Compounding. Compounding takes place whenever you earn interest on interest. It has the potential to 
increase the value of an investment exponentially over time. Zach's original investment o f $300 grew by 
$30 over the first year. In the second year, Zach experienced a 10% gain on his original $300 plus  on the 
additional $30 that he had earned during the first year. In the third year, Zach experienc ed another 10% 
on his original $300 plus on the additional $63 that he had earned during the first two years. O pportunity 
cost refers to the trade-off that occurs when you choose one alternative over another. Banking servic es is 
a career area in which employees are primarily concerned with accepting deposits, lending fun ds, and 
extending credit to bank customers. Globalization refers to the rapid and unimpeded flow of capital, labor, 
and ideas across national borders.

32,"33. To be able to pay for unexpected car repairs and/or to replace broken home appliances, it is important to 
",A. eliminate entertainment expenses.,B. make long-term investments.,C. save money for emergency situations.,D. use tax returns to purchase treasury bonds.,"33. C 
Save money for emergency situations. It is important to allocate a portion of savings to pay for 
unexpected expenses that occur in day- to-day life. At some point, everyone will have a car or home 
appliance that breaks down and needs repaired or replaced. Individuals do not use long-term 
investments to pay for immediate or short-term expenses. If you don't save money for emergency 
situations, you may need to cut back on the money you spend on entertainment (e.g., going to th e 
movies) for a while, but you shouldn't need to eliminate entertainment expenses altogether. Investi ng 
money that you receive from your tax return will not help you cover unexpected or emergency ex penses.

term deal. It takes time to accumulate wealth. Investing also brings risks, but it also can bring greater 
reward. 
"
34,"35. Viola wants to go on a vacation sometime in the next year. How should she generate the money she 
needs for the trip? 
",A. Invest her money in the stock market,B. Put her money in a savings account,C. Take some money from her emergency fund,D. Put the expenses for the trip on a credit card,"35. B 
Put her money in a savings account. For short-term financial goals, such as Viola's vac ation, using a 
savings account is a better option than investing in the stock market. While Viola won't earn as  much in 
interest as she would in returns, investments fluctuate frequently, are riskier, and take time to become 
profitable. Viola might lose more money than she makes before her trip. If possible, Viola shoul d not take 
money from her emergency fund for a vacation because if she does, she will not have the money she  
needs if an emergency occurs. She also should not put the expenses for the trip on a credit card unless 
she already has the money to pay off the credit card saved; otherwise, she will get into fi nancial trouble.

35,"36. What type of services do property taxes typically fund? 
",A. State/Provincial education programs and federal correctional facilities,B. National security programs and local road repairs,C. Local fire departments and local law-enforcement agencies,D. State/Provincial colleges and state/provincial social welfare initiatives,"36. C 
Local fire departments and local law-enforcement agencies. Local governments levy property tax es on 
land, commercial facilities, and residences within their jurisdictions. Revenues collec ted from property 
taxes pay for local services including local road repairs, public schools, fire departments, a nd law 
enforcement. The federal government uses the tax revenues that it collects in a variety of ways ( e.g., 
income tax) to fund national security programs and federal correctional facilities. State/Provincial  
governments collect taxes (e.g., sales tax) to support all levels of education and social wel fare iniatives 
within their jurisdications.

Tax liability. A tax liability is tax that a person or business must pay the governm ent. Certain events, like 
annual income, an inheritance, and money from the sale of an asset, are taxable. Since citizens mus t pay 
money on these sources of income, it is not untaxable income or a tax loophole. Sales tax is a t ype of tax 
that is paid on the sale of goods and services.

excluding holiday hours (11 + 8 + 9.5 + 9 + 9 = 46.5). Next, determine his overtime hours by s ubtracting 
40 from the total number of non-holiday hours he worked (46.5 - 40 = 6.5). Calculate Brad's pa y for the 
first 40 hours of his workweek by multiplying his regular pay by 40 hours ($8.70 X 40 = $348.00). Then, 
calculate his overtime hourly wage by multiplying his regular hourly pay by time a nd one-half ($8.70 X 1.5 
= $13.05). Multiply his overtime hourly wage by the number of overtime hours worked ($13.05 X 6.5 = 
$84.83). Next, calculate his holiday pay per hour by doubling his regular hourly pay ($8 .70 X 2 = $17.40). 
Multiply his holiday pay per hour by the number of holiday hours worked ($17.40 X 5 = $ 87.00). Finally, 
add together his regular pay, his overtime pay, and his holiday pay to find his total gross  earnings for the 
week ($348.00 + $84.83 + $87.00 = $519.83).

transactions in her check register. Keeping an accurate check register helps Melissa 
",A. understand the checking account's restrictions and fees.,B. determine when she needs to add funds to her savings account.,C. track the amount of money she has spent.,D. decide when to order new checks.,"39. C 
Track the amount of money she has spent. A check is a negotiable instrument or bank draft mad e 
payable to a specific party for a specific amount of money. A check serves as a written promi se to the 
check bearer that money is available in the issuer's bank account. Checks are a common form o f 
financial exchange. Both individuals and businesses use checks to pay for goods and serv ices such as 
rent, utilities, food, and supplies. When writing a check, an individual or business kee ps a check register 
that records information about the transaction. This information includes the date the check is written, to  
whom the check is made payable, the amount of the check, and the check number. The register is a 
central location to record and track all of the checks written and the amount of money spent. Check 
registers do not help the check issuers determine when to add funds to a savings account, un derstand 
the checking account's restrictions and fees, or decide when to order new checks.

Checkbook balance. Reconciling a bank statement is the process of determining any differences 
between the bank statement balance and the checkbook balance. A company's balance sheet is n ot part 
of maintaining a personal bank account or its records. Canceled checks and deposit slips are used d uring 
bank -statement reconciliation to determine if accurate records have been kept. An installment is a 
specific sum of money to be paid at regular intervals by the borrower to the lender.

40,"41. As Tom uses his credit card to make purchases in a responsible manner, he should remember that cr edit 
is a(n) 
",A. tax.,B. privilege.,C. asset.,D. loan.,"41. D 
Loan. A loan is a sum of money lent to a person or business for a specific time period that is  repayable 
with interest. Credit is the arrangement by which a person purchases now and pays later. A l ending 
institution issues credit cards, which allow people to purchase now and pay later. The lender pr ovides 
credit card users with a limit within which they can charge purchases. The lender pays for the purchases 
and then sends the credit card user a bill/statement each month that indicates the monthly minimum  
payment and interest charges due to the lender. It is important for people to pay credit card balan ces 
responsibly so they do not accumulate so much debt that they cannot afford to pay the lender. Us ing 
credit for purchases helps a person build a personal credit history, which lenders cons ider when a person 
applies for a large loan to purchase a car or a house. An asset is something of value that a person o wns. 
Credit is not an asset or a tax. Because credit is so widely used, it is not necessarily a privilege.

",A. Close all of his older credit cards,B. Apply for another credit card,C. Pay his bills by the date they are due,D. Increase the amount of money owed,"42. C 
Pay his bills by the date they are due. The most important thing Eito can do to rebuild hi s credit is to pay 
his bills by the date they are due. A lot of new credit can hurt a person's credit history a nd Eito should not 
apply for more credit while he is trying to rebuild his credit score. Closing older credit c ards is not the best 
choice because longer-term credit actually helps a person's credit score. Eito should try to lower the 
amount of money owed instead of increasing it.

associated with 
",A. personal hijacking.,B. property infringement.,C. identity theft.,D. securities fraud.,"43. C 
Identity theft. Monitoring financial accounts and reading bank statements helps you identify  unusual 
transactions, purchases, or money withdrawals. If inconsistencies are detected, you can notif y your 
financial-services providers to hold or close your accounts to prevent further use by identity thie ves. 
Intellectual property infringement involves using copyrighted, trademarked, or patented pro perty without 
the owner's permission. Hijacking is using force to seize a vehicle (e.g., aircraft, car) i n transit. Securities 
fraud involves using deception to convince investors to purchase securities.

subtract his contributions to his approved retirement fund, his exemption amount, and his standar d 
deduction from his gross income for the year ($37,800 - $2,000 - $3,650 - $5,700 = $26,4 50).

Direct withdrawal. This occurs when one account holder (Juliet and Tony) gives permission  to another 
account holder (the day care center) to automatically take funds from their bank account. This typica lly 
occurs on a regular basis (monthly) for a fixed amount. Online bill pay is when a consumer uses the

",A. Notify businesses to let them know that time extensions will be needed.,B. Pay bills as soon as they arrive.,C. Require businesses to use direct deposit into your account.,D. Set aside two times a month to pay bills.,"46. D 
Set aside two times a month to pay bills. By establishing a schedule for bill paying, you ca n help yourself 
pay your bills on time. Generally, paying bills at the middle and the end of each month is  an effective 
schedule to follow. Paying bills as soon as they arrive results in lost interest that could be  earned on your 
money. Many businesses offer customers the option of having the amount of their monthly bil ls directly 
deposited into the businesses' accounts rather than the businesses making deposits into customer 
accounts. Notifying businesses that you will be late making your payments will  not keep the businesses 
from charging late fees on your bills.

",A. credit union.,B. Internet bank.,C. commercial bank.,D. investment bank.,"48. A 
Credit union. Amira would likely be happy banking with a credit union. Credi t unions are not-for-profit 
financial institutions that are owned by their members. Because of this, they have  the customers' best 
interests at heart. They also usually have better interest rates and lower fees than some other types of 
financial institutions. If Amira enjoys doing her banking in person, an Internet bank would l ikely be a bad 
choice for her. Internet banks do all of their transactions online. Amira also wouldn't be happy wi th a 
commercial bank. Although commercial banks offer a wide array of services, they do not always  offer

Backgrounds of management. In fundamental analysis, both quantitative and qualitative factors are 
examined to help in determining a company's value. Quantitative factors include ratios and compari sons. 
Ratios are used to determine earnings per share and a company's profitability. A comparison of sal es 
over a five-year period is an example of the type of comparisons that investors should make. Qua litative 
factors are subjective measures such as the company's product mix, the level of competition, 
backgrounds of management, strategies, and brand strength. Investors should examine both quantitative

Shareholders and potential investors evaluate the financial statements so they can mak e informed 
investing decisions. The financial statements are included in the company's annual report. On e way that 
public corporations make their annual reports available for review is by posting them  on their company

Net change. Newspapers, business publications, and websites publish a  securities or stock table, which 
is a format used to list stock quotes. The table helps investors monitor the performance of their stocks. 
The net change is a column in the table that indicates the difference between a stock's clos ing price and

",A. Investors earn interest because it is a lending investment.,B. Investors are guaranteed a minimal amount of return.,C. Investors have access to a fund manager's expertise.,D. Investors' fees are waived because it is an ownership investment.,"56. C 
Investors have access to a fund manager's expertise. A mutual fund is a type of ownership investment 
that involves collecting money from many people and then investing it in an ass ortment of different 
securities such as stocks or bonds. The benefit to shareholders of placing money in mutual funds is t hat 
a well-trained fund manager has the expertise to make smart investment decisions on their b ehalf. 
Shareholders are not guaranteed a minimal amount of return on their mutual-fund investments, but 
because the funds are spread out among different securities, the risk of a total financial loss is red uced. 
Disadvantages to investing in mutual funds are that shareholders pay fees for someone to manage thei r 
investments, and the mutual-fund earnings are taxable.

invest her money in a 
",A. savings account.,B. stock.,C. certificate of deposit (CD).,D. money market account (MMA).,"57. A 
Savings account. If Sheila doesn't like to take risks, wants to access all of her money at al l times, and 
doesn't mind earning very little interest, she should consider a savings account. You're alway s able to 
access your money, but you receive a low return. A stock is much riskier than a savings accou nt—you 
actually own part of the company, so you have the rights and responsibilities that go along with 
ownership. This means you can make a big profit, but you can also lose a large amount of m oney if the 
stock decreases in value or if the company goes out of business. While a certificate of  deposit (CD) 
doesn't have a high risk, you aren't able to access your money at all for a set period of time. A money 
market account (MMA) is low risk, but you are only able to access some of your mon ey each month, and 
you usually have to keep a certain amount of money in your account.

Collectibles and real estate. Ownership investments are those in which an individual purchases a porti on 
or all of an item. Collectibles (e.g., coins and antiques), real estate (e.g., buildings and land), and stoc ks 
(shares of a corporation) are types of ownership investments. With a lending investment, you allow

a corporation. As an owner (or shareholder), the investor has the rights and responsibilities of ownership 
(attending shareholders' meetings, voting, receiving a portion of the company's earning s, etc.). A money 
market account is a lending investment in which an individual lends a minimum amou nt of money to a

",A. Roth IRAs.,B. traditional IRAs.,C. 401(k) plans.,D. Keogh plans.,"61. C 
401(k) plans. Many employers offer 401(k) plans, which are defined-contribution pension pl ans, to their 
employees. Employees contribute to their 401(k) plans on a pretax basis, and many employers  match 
employees' contributions up to a certain percentage. Both the employee's and employer's contribution s 
become part of the employee's nest-egg for retirement. A traditional IRA (individual retirement accou nt) is 
a personal savings plan that an employee can set up independent of her/his employer. Con tributions to a 
traditional IRA are usually tax deductible, but the money in the account is taxed when it is  withdrawn 
during retirement. Money contributed to a Roth IRA is not tax deductible, but the money wit hdrawn from a 
Roth IRA during retirement is not taxed. A Keogh plan is a defined contribution pension pl an specifically 
for self-employed individuals. Contributions to a Keogh plan are typically t ax-deductible, but withdrawals 
from the account during retirement are taxed. 
"
61,"62. A good retirement plan usually accounts for increasing __________ costs. 
",A. mortgage,B. medical care,C. life insurance,D. legal,"62. B 
Medical care. The cost of medical care tends to increase significantly later in life, and a goo d retirement 
plan considers how to meet those costs. Usually by the time of retirement, the costs of a mortgage hav e 
been eliminated. There is usually less need for life insurance later in life. Legal costs are not a big

value of its stock.","63. C 
Investors can rely on reputable, independent sources for analysis of financial statements . By using 
reliable, independent sources, an investor can be relatively certain the EPS (and other)  figures are 
consistent and useful. Financial ratios are useful to people besides financial managers and investors, 
including lenders, suppliers, and the government. A line- by-line analysis of a company's financial 
statements is not necessarily the best way to understand the value of a stock. As investors, we loo k at 
ratios that help us determine whether to buy, sell, or hold a company's stock. Finally, depend ing on a 
company's accounting policies, it's possible for earnings to be distorted. Accounting deci sions, which 
directly affect earnings, are made at the discretion of each company.

business. Luckily, Ruchita doesn't have to pay the damages because she has __________ insurance. 
",A. property,B. life,C. liability,D. health,"66. C 
Liability. Liability insurance provides compensation for losses caused by injuries, acci dents, and 
negligence. It protects businesses like Ruchita's from having to pay for liability-re lated costs themselves. 
Life insurance provides coverage to beneficiaries when the policyholder dies. Property i nsurance 
compensates business owners if their buildings, equipment, or inventory are damaged or lost. If  a fire or 
flood wipes out a business's inventory, property insurance can help the business avoid compl ete financial 
ruin. Health insurance helps employees pay for their doctor visits, medicine, and any other heal th care 
related expenses. 
"
66,"67. A common transference device is a(n) 
",A. contingency plan.,B. smoke alarm.,C. insurance policy.,D. risk checklist.,"67. C 
Insurance policy. Transference is a risk-response strategy that involves moving the impact of  a risk to 
someone or something else. An insurance policy, which is a common transference device, is a 
contractual agreement in which one company (the insurer) will pay for specified losses inc urred by the 
other company (the insured) in return for installment payments (premiums). Smoke alarms help to 
mitigate or reduce the damage that a fire could cause to a property. A contingency plan is a se t of 
specific guidelines and activities used when responding to undesirable circums tances. Businesses need 
to develop contingency plans in the event that risks that they have accepted actually oc cur. A risk 
checklist is a standardized list of risks that a business faces on a regular basis. It i s often used to speed 
up the risk-identification process.

Cyan Printing Company against the original 
",A. item number.,B. price quotation.,C. delivery date.,D. inventory report.,"68. B 
Price quotation. A price quotation is an estimate of the costs associated with a project or product. 
Companies (e.g., advertising agencies) often provide specifications that require one or more ven dors to 
provide them with a price quotation to complete a particular business activity, such as a catalog  or 
brochure print job. The price quotation allows the company or agency to determine which vendor would 
best meet their needs in a cost-effective manner. After completing the project, the vendor sends an  
invoice (bill) to the agency. If the agency thinks that the bill is too high, it can refer to the  price quotation it 
was given before beginning the project and compare the quotation with the bill. The printer's item  
number, delivery date, and inventory reports would not be helpful in determining if th ere are cost-
associated problems on the invoice.

",A. Keeps your assets from going through probate court,B. Maximizes the amount of money that goes to foundations,C. Encourages you to develop financial goals,D. Ensures that your assets are divided the way you want them to be,"71. D 
Ensures that your assets are divided the way you want them to be. Estate planning gives you th e 
opportunity to determine who will get your assets when you die. It also designates how much eac h 
beneficiary will receive from the estate. Effective estate planning will keep your ben eficiaries from having 
to pay estate taxes, thereby maximizing the amount of money that they inherit. Foundatio ns would only 
receive your assets if they have been designated as beneficiaries. Retirement planning, rat her than 
estate planning, encourages you to develop financial goals. To avoid probate court, your ass ets would 
have to be put into a trust. Just having a will does not keep your beneficiaries out of proba te court.

Lower. APR stands for annual percentage rate, which represents the amount of interest on your total lo an 
that you'll pay annually. It takes into account the interest rates, the length of the loan agreement, an d 
other fees or charges. If you have a lower APR, your monthly payments will be lower. A higher APR

employees: 
",A. Worker's compensation,B. Competitive pay,C. Flexible scheduling,D. Health insurance,"73. C 
Flexible scheduling. Offering a flexible schedule or flex-time is a work-life balance benefit that many 
employees desire to have, so it may help attract and keep top employees. Competitive pay, worker' s 
compensation, and health insurance do not represent benefits that help an employee manage work- life 
balance.

73,"74. Deena is researching investment options. How can she best evaluate the authority of a source of 
information? 
",A. Check to see if facts and statistics are cited,B. See when the source was published,C. Look into the author's credentials,D. Look for potential signs of bias,"74. C 
Look into the author's credentials. Authority means being a qualified expert on the sub ject. Sources of 
information should have authority to be considered reliable. To evaluate authority, Deen a should look into 
the author's credentials to see whether or not the author is an expert source. Authors who have been 
published many times in other reputable sources generally can be considered authoritati ve. Seeing when 
the source was published is a way to evaluate timeliness rather than authority. Checking to see if  facts 
and statistics are cited is a way to evaluate accuracy, not authority. Looking for signs of bias is  a way to 
evaluate objectivity rather than authority.

car? 
",A. The other driver's insurance compan y,B. Her insurance company,C. The other driver,D. Jamie must pay all damages herself,"75. B 
Her insurance company. Since Jamie has comprehensive insurance coverage, all damages will be 
covered by her insurance company even though Jamie is at fault for the accident. T he other driver's 
insurance company would not pay for Jamie's damages since Jamie was at fault. Since the other driv er 
was not at fault, s/he is not responsible for the damages. 
"
75,"76. A business might be involved in insurance fraud if it  
",A. calculates the value of property.,B. attempts to reduce the coverage.,C. overestimates the amount of loss.,D. limits its scope of liability.,"76. C 
Overestimates the amount of loss. Fraud is a deception purposely carried out to secure unfair or unlaw ful 
gain. If a business deliberately overestimates the amount of loss in an attempt to receive a l arger 
settlement, it might be involved in insurance fraud. The business is trying to obtain c ompensation for a 
loss it did not incur. A business is not involved in insurance fraud if it attempts to re duce the coverage, 
calculates the value of property, or limits its scope of liability.

76,"77. Chris started working in a stable as a horse trainer, but later decided he would rather give riding  lessons 
for a living. This is an example of a goal being 
",A. measurable.,B. effective.,C. specific.,D. dynamic.,"77. D 
Dynamic. Goals are dynamic, meaning they are flexible and can be changed. In this case, Chris c hanged 
his career goal from grooming horses to giving riding lessons. Good goals are specific, measurabl e, and 
effective, but Chris's example does not illustrate these traits. 
"
77,"78. Which of the following is a benefit of writing down your goal: 
",A. Changing your goal when necessary,B. Clarifying the goal in your own mind,C. Picturing what it would be like to reach your goal,D. Sequencing smaller subgoals,"78. B 
Clarifying the goal in your own mind. A benefit of writing down your goal is being a ble to clarify it in your 
own mind as you look at it on paper. Changing your goal when necessary is a benefit of revie wing and 
updating your goal regularly. Sequencing smaller subgoals is a benefit of breaking down y our main goal. 
And, picturing what it would be like to reach your goal is visualizing your goal. 
"
78,"79. Which of the following is an example of gathering information before making a decision: 
",A. Reading novels,B. Writing letters,C. Asking questions,D. Watching movies,"79. C 
Asking questions. Before individuals can make decisions, they need to obtain info rmation about the 
problem or situation. One way of gathering information is to ask questions of friends, family, cow orkers, 
or supervisors. Asking questions enables individuals to gather additional information tha t may be useful 
in helping them make good decisions. Watching movies, writing letters, and reading nove ls are not ways 
of obtaining information to use in decision-making. 
"
79,"80. Because Jason objectively reviewed all the facts from a variety of perspectives before making his 
business decision, he was basing his decision on 
",A. emotion.,B. logic.,C. intuition.,D. experiences.,"80. B 
Logic. Decision-making is the process of choosing among alternatives. Many factors influenc e how a 
person makes decisions. When a businessperson gathers facts, and reviews them from  a variety of 
perspectives without bias, s/he is using logic to make a decision. Emotions are feelings ba sed on 
attitudes, values, and temperament. Intuition is a person's ""gut feeling"" or insight about som ething. 
Experiences are past occurrences. Emotions, intuition, and experiences are internal factors th at often 
affect a person's decisions; however, these options do not involve objectively revi ewing facts from a 
variety of perspectives. 
"
80,"81. Following a business employee for a few days to obtain information about that particular career is an 
example of 
",A. personal interviewing.,B. volunteering.,C. serving an internship.,D. job shadowing.,"81. D 
Job shadowing. To obtain information about specific occupations and careers, it is sometimes po ssible to 
follow an employee who performs a certain job. This is an example of job shadowing, and gives  an 
individual the opportunity to find out exactly what a certain job involves. An individua l might follow an 
employee for a few days, watch what the employee does, listen to conversations with coworkers , and 
possibly help with simple tasks. Volunteering involves donating time to complete a proj ect. An internship 
is training in which schools and businesses cooperate to provide on- the-job practice for learners. 
Although an individual shadowing an employee might ask questions, following an e mployee is not an 
example of interviewing. 
"
81,"82. Individuals who are interested in certain occupations should also find out if they have  the necessary 
",A. patience.,B. attitudes.,C. aptitudes.,D. behavior.,"82. C 
Aptitudes. Aptitudes are abilities needed for a specific job or the natural talents for learning spe cific skills. 
Individuals should find out if they have the aptitudes to do the jobs that are of interest to them. For 
example, a person who is interested in banking might not do well in math courses. Although the person 
has an interest in banking, s/he does not have the aptitude to be successful in that occupation. Beh avior 
is the manner in which individuals act. Attitude is the way a person looks at life. Patien ce is the ability to 
endure life's aggravations and difficulties calmly.

",A. graphic designer.,B. math teacher.,C. computer programmer.,D. financial planner.,"83. B 
Math teacher. Individuals must consider many personal factors when deciding which career to pursue, 
including their interests, aptitudes, and personality traits. When determining the caree r in which she will 
be most happy and successful, Alexa must consider all of these factors. Because she enjoys worki ng 
with children and has an aptitude for helping them understand puzzles and numerical formulas, she m ight 
consider a career as a math teacher. Graphic designers, computer programmers, and financial pla nners 
should have an aptitude for mathematical concepts, but these careers do not involve working w ith 
children.

level position as a(n) 
",A. apprentice plant manager.,B. junior bookkeeper.,C. customer service representative.,D. assistant office supervisor.,"84. C 
Customer service representative. There are many employment opportunities in the marketing segment of 
business. Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communi cating, 
and delivering value to customers, and for managing customer relationships in ways that benef it the 
organization and its stakeholders. As a result, customer service is an important part of marketing. 
Individuals who want to pursue a career in marketing often obtain entry-level positions as c ustomer 
service representatives. This position gives them experience in working with customers and le arning the 
business's product. Then, they often have the opportunity to move up in the marketing department. 
Junior bookkeeper, apprentice plant manager, and assistant office supervisor are not entry-l evel 
positions in marketing.

84,"85. What type of information is acceptable to leave out of a job application? 
",A. Professional experience,B. Educational background,C. Contact information,D. Salary requirements,"85. D 
Salary requirements. It is not necessary for applicants to specify their salary requir ements on a job 
application. Applicants usually want to have the opportunity to discuss salary in per son rather than run 
the risk of asking for too much or too little before obtaining an interview. Educational background, con tact 
information, and professional experience are examples of the types of information that should be 
included in a job application. 
"
85,"86. Lauren was filling out an employment application and encountered a question for which sh e was unsure 
of the answer. What should she do? 
","A. Mark down ""personal""",B. Leave a blank space,C. Make up an answer,"D. Write in ""unknown""","86. D 
Write in ""unknown."" On occasion, people will encounter questions on employment applic ations for which 
they do not know the answer. When this situation occurs, it is acceptable to write ""unk nown"" in the space. 
This indicates that the applicant has read the question but either doesn't have the information ava ilable or 
doesn't know the answer. It is always better to write in ""unknown"" or ""NA"" than to leave a bl ank space 
that might make an employer think that an applicant forgot to answer the question. Applicants should 
never make up answers. Employment applications are not allowed to contain the types of qu estions that 
would obtain strictly personal information from applicants, such as age or religious preference. 
"
86,"87. Which of the following is the most desirable outcome for a job seeker who sends a letter of appl ication to 
a business: 
",A. A telephone call from the business,B. A letter from the business,C. A job interview for the applicant,D. A request for a résumé from the applicant,"87. C 
A job interview for the applicant. A letter of application is often called a cover letter because i t is usually 
sent along with a résumé. The intent of the job applicant is to obtain a job interview by i ntroducing 
him/herself in the letter and presenting background information in the résumé. A job seeker who receives 
a letter in response to a letter of application is not likely to be receiving good news since most b usinesses 
use letters to reject applicants. The business may respond by telephoning the applic ant or asking for a 
résumé if none has been sent, but setting up an interview is the most desirable outcome for the applic ant. 
"
87,"88. People most often write letters of application when responding to job leads they have found 
",A. in publicity brochures.,B. on the Internet.,C. in business windows.,D. through networking.,"88. B 
On the Internet. People often write letters of application when responding to jobs listed online. The 
purpose of the letter is to briefly explain the person's qualifications for the advertised j ob. The letter of 
application, or cover letter, usually accompanies the person's resume. People usually do no t find job 
leads in publicity brochures. People who see ""help wanted"" signs in store windows general ly apply in 
person rather than write letters of application. Finally, a letter of application is less l ikely when the job is 
found through networking because the person has already had the chance to explain his/her 
qualifications while networking. 
"
88,"89. Which of the following are the best references to list in a résumé: 
",A. Former employers,B. Family members,C. Coworkers,D. Classmates,"89. A 
Former employers. The reference section of a résumé should list two or three people who can provide 
information about you. The best references are former employers, because they can accurately describe 
your work habits, abilities, and attitudes toward the job. Prospective employers will want to contact these 
references to find out if you performed satisfactorily in former positions. Potential employers usua lly do 
not want to contact your classmates, family members, and coworkers because they are personal  
references who may be unable to provide unbiased information about you. 
"
89,"90. An effective résumé provides a prospective employer with the information needed to judge the ap plicant's 
qualifications without being 
",A. detailed.,B. lengthy.,C. specific.,D. concise.,"90. B 
Lengthy. Effective résumés should provide sufficient information to adequately explai n the applicant's 
qualifications without being lengthy. Most employers have limited time and want t o be able to obtain the 
important information in a résumé as quickly as possible. The ideal résumé is one page in lengt h and 
presents important facts in as few words as possible. The information in a résumé should be conci se but 
also as specific and detailed as necessary in order to provide an accurate explanation of th e applicant's 
qualifications.

",A. higher than an individual policy.,B. lower than an individual policy.,C. paid for by the employer.,D. paid for by the government.,"93. B 
Lower than an individual policy. Health insurance purchased through an employer usually  costs less than 
individual policies because it can be purchased at group rates. Some employers pay a porti on of health 
insurance costs, but many offer the opportunity and let the employee pay the entire cost. T he 
government does not typically cover the employee's cost for a health insurance policy. 
"
93,"94. One reason why many workers begin their careers in entry-level jobs is because the se jobs 
",A. are limited to small businesses.,B. offer very low compensation.,C. provide no room for advancement.,D. require little or no experience.,"94. D 
Require little or no experience. Entry-level jobs are the beginning point in most occupati ons because they 
require little or no experience. Many people entering the workplace for the first time do not have a lot of 
work experience, if any. Therefore, they often begin their careers in entry-level jobs to gain the 
experience they need to be able to advance and move up the career ladder. Not all entry-lev el jobs offer 
very low compensation. Many entry-level jobs are the stepping stones to advancement once w orkers 
have more experience. Entry-level jobs are available in all types of businesses, regardless of  size.

product/service management: 
",A. Testing products very carefully,B. Promoting products to target audiences,C. Modifying products to meet consumer demand,D. Marketing products in new geographic areas,"96. A 
Testing products very carefully. Even though products have been well designed, they should also be  
thoroughly tested before they are put on the market. The tests should be done according to the ways in 
which consumers will use the products. Promoting products to target audiences is an aspect of 
promotion. Modifying products to meet consumer demand and marketing them in new geographic areas 
are aspects of product/service management but are not involved with consumer protection. 
"
96,"97. Which of the following might a business experience if it failed to provide adequate consumer pr otection: 
",A. Personal injury,B. Property damage,C. Physical harm,D. Financial loss,"97. D 
Financial loss. Businesses that fail to provide adequate consumer protection may experience f inancial 
loss caused by consumer lawsuits, government fines, defective products that cannot be sold, a nd unsafe

best question for Jane to ask to help her negotiate a lower fee from Mateo: 
","A. ""What is the lowest price you can give me?""","B. ""What can you offer that no one else can?""","C. ""What prices do your competitors offer?""","D. ""Why do I have to pay fees?""","99. B 
""What can you offer that no one else can?"" When negotiating the terms of a sale or agreement, it is a 
good idea to use leverage and determine what value the other person has to offer. Jane can determi ne 
what value Mateo is willing to add —including a lower fee —by asking him what sets him apart from 
competitors. Asking for the lowest price, competitors' pricing, or why she needs to pay fees are n ot as 
likely to give Jane the negotiating leverage she needs to obtain a lower fee.
