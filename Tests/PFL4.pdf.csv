0,"1. Businesses usually are unable to enter into legally binding contracts with  
",A. minors.,B. senior citizens.,C. foreigners.,D. tourists.,"1. A 
Minors.  Businesses usually are prevented from entering into legally binding contracts with certain groups 
of people because these people are not considered to have the capacity to understand the 
consequences of their actions. One of these groups includes minors, those people under the legal age. 
In most cases, minors cannot enter into legally binding contracts because they are not old enough to be 
responsible for the consequences. Businesses usually may enter into legally binding contracts with 
people who are adul ts, older than the legal age, regardless of whether they are foreigners, senior 
citizens, or tourists.

9,"10. What usually decreases as the rate of inflation increases?  
",A. Purchasing power,B. Interest rates,C. Export  quotas,D. Money supply,"10. A 
Purchasing power. Purchasing power is a consumer's ability to purchase goods and services. The rate of 
inflation, the percentage of change in price levels, has a major effect on purchasing power because when 
inflation is high, a dollar will not buy as much . For example, if the rate of inflation increases from last year 
to this year, $1.00 will buy less this year than it did last year. If inflation increases and incomes stay the 
same, people will lose purchasing power and not be able to buy the same amount o f goods and services. 
Money supply is the total quantity of money that exists at one time in a nation. The interest rate is the 
percentage figure used in calculating interest charges. Export quotas are the restrictions on the quantity 
of goods that can mov e out of a country.

minimum payments toward his debt each month. At the end of the year, however, he notices that his 
overall balance has gone up quite a bit. This is a result of  
",A. income tax.,B. the cost of credit.,C. social security.,D. Craig's credit score.,"32. B 
The cost of credit. When you take out a line of credit, you agree to terms and conditions that outline how 
and when you will pay the money back. Most lines of credit have interest rates, which means that the 
lender can collect additional money from you if you fail to pay back the loan by a certain time. This is the 
cost of credit. By making only the minimum payment each month, Craig's credit balance increased  due to 
accumulated interest. The increased balance is not a result of income tax, social security, or Craig's 
credit score.

recognized  credit bureaus or agencies, which maintain files of credit information on individuals and

Identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains another person's information and uses 
that information to assume the other person's identity. One way to protect against identity theft is to 
immediately contact the credit c ard company if a credit card is lost. If the card falls into the hands of an 
unauthorized person, that person can attempt to use the card as if they are the owner of the card. This is 
a type of identity theft. If someone uses another person's credit card i llegally, the penalty for the victim is 
not excessive, and in many situations, there is no penalty if the company is notified before any illegal use 
occurs. Therefore, there is virtually no financial risk. Immediately contacting the credit card company 
does not protect against high interest rates.

Giving your ATM card to a bank teller should not put you at risk of credit card fraud, because bank tellers

weeks with the  
",A. estimated dividends.,B. rate of return.,C. price -earnings ratio.,D. lowest paid price in the past 52 weeks.,"57. D 
Lowest paid price in the past 52 weeks. A  securities or stock table is a format used to list stock quote s in 
newspapers and on websites. The table helps people monitor the performance of a company's stock. To 
analyze the volatility of stock, an investor or potential investor can compare the highest price paid with 
the lowest price paid within a 52 -week perio d. If a stock's price rises or falls sharply, it is said to be 
volatile, which means investors can earn or lose a great deal of money by owning the stock. Rate of 
return is the reward or benefit received in return for an investment and is recorded as a per centage of the 
investment. Price -earning ratio (PE) is the  financial ratio that shows how much investors are willing to pay 
for each dollar of earnings. A dividend is a portion of a company's profits paid to shareholders, usually on 
a quarterly basis. The rate of return, price -earnings ratio, and estimated dividends would not give 
investors enough information to analyze the stock's volatility.

with a high dividend yield is typically less volatile than one with a low yield. Investors often compare the 
yield percent ages of similar companies with different stock prices to make investing decisions. The 
volume (VOL) column in a stock table indicates how many shares were traded that day. The net change 
(NET CHG) column in the table indicates the difference between a stoc k's closing price and the previous 
day's price, which may increase or decrease. The ticker or ticker symbol (STOCK [SYM]) column

",A. To achieve plans for the future,B. To buy common stock,C. To reduce overall debt,D. To borrow capital,"60. A 
To achieve plans  for the future. Everyone has plans for the future such as buying a home, starting a 
business, or retiring at a young age. To make these plans a reality, it is important to establish investment 
goals to accumulate the funds that will be needed. For example , an individual might establish an 
investment goal of saving $10,000 in two years to make a down payment on a house. To achieve a 
specific investment goal, an individual might buy stock in a company because the stock is increasing in 
value. Reducing overal l debt is one way to save money that can be invested. Individuals do not establish 
investment goals to borrow capital.

insurance coverage should he purchase?  
",A. Gap insurance,B. Collision,C. Liability,D. Comprehensive,"64. C 
Liability. Liability insurance pays for damage and injuries you cause others in a ccidents, and it is required 
by law in most states/provinces. When a car has little financial value, owners often choose to only carry 
liability insurance that will pay for damages and injuries caused to others. Since collision, gap, and 
comprehensive insu rance are optional insurance products that pay for damages to your car, they are not 
necessary. Collision insurance pays for damages to your car if your car crashes into an object, hits 
another vehicle, or flips over. Gap insurance is an insurance product that covers the difference between 
the amount owed on a loan or lease and the amount an auto insurer is willing to pay for a heavily 
damaged car. Comprehensive insurance protects against damages from causes other than collision 
(e.g., fire, theft, water, f alling objects, and vandalism).

invest a lump sum now and watch it grow over time, at an interest rate of 5% annually, until she has 
enough to make a down payment of $40,000 on the home.  What is the minimum amount (rounded up to

","A. $15,095","B. $4,193","C. $20,000","D. $8,000","66. A 
$15,095. To determine how much money Rhea needs to invest to reach her goal, use the time val ue of 
money formula, which is Present Value = Future Value / (1 + interest rate)period. First, determine the future 
value of the investment, which is $40,000. Then, determine the interest rate, which is 5%, and the 
number of periods (20 years). Next, add o ne to the interest rate and raise that sum to the power of the 
number of periods (1 + 5% [or .05] = 1.05; 1.0520 = 2.65). Finally, divide the future value by this product to 
determine the present value ($40,000 / 2.65 = $15,094.34). Therefore, Rhea needs t o invest about 
$15,095 to reach her goal.

Think long term and be realistic about income and expenses. When taking on debt, you need to be 
honest about whether you will be able to repay the debt. You have to think about whether there are 
anticipated changes in your income and expenses over the life of the debt that would  keep you from 
repaying it. Impulse buying creates unmanageable debt rather than avoids it. Debt payments must be 
made in a timely manner. If you anticipate that timely repayment will be a problem, don't consider taking 
on additional debt. Although cosigne rs may be needed to obtain a loan, you should understand that both 
your credit rating and that of the cosigners will be damaged by your late payment.

Who will oversee the terms of my will? Estate planning involves determining how assets will be managed 
and distributed after death. One important aspect of estate planning is naming an executor to oversee the 
will and make sure it is carried out according to the person's wishes. Determining an amount of 401(k) 
contributions is an example of retirement planning. Determining an amount of money to spend on

pursue federal loans first because  
",A. they generally have the lowest interest rates.,B. private loans are almost nonexistent.,C. federal loans are the most challenging to be approved for.,D. they usually do not need to be repaid.,"89. A 
They generally have the lowest interest rates. Federal loans are generally the easiest loans for students 
to receive because they do not require an excellent credit score or a cosigner. Federal loans also tend to 
have lower interest rates than private loans. Private loans are ple ntiful, but they generally have much 
higher interest rates and require a cosigner or a good credit history to obtain. Like all loans, federal loans 
must be repaid. The only type of aid product that does not need to be repaid is a grant.

Are considered a dependent. Under many health insurance systems, children and young adults are 
covered by  their parents' or guardians' family health insurance plans. If you are covered, you are not 
breaking the law. You are not necessarily required to demonstrate financial need to be covered under 
your parents' health insurance. Finally, you should not be exc luded from receiving full health care 
benefits if you are covered under your parents' health insurance.

90,"91. It is a good idea to purchase life insurance as a young adul t because  
",A. it takes time for the policy to become active.,B. younger people pay lower premiums.,C. policies have limited time periods.,D. young people often have dependents.,"91. B 
Younger people pay lower premiums. The younger you are when you purchase life insurance, the lower 
your rates will be because you are less likely to need an insurance payout. Therefore, it is a good idea to 
purchase life insurance as soon as possible to receive a low premium rate. The process of obtaining a 
life insurance policy should not take more than a few months at most, so this is not a reason to purchase 
life insurance as a young adult. Some life insurance policies have limit ed term periods, but this is not a 
reason to purchase life insurance at a young age. Young people may or may not have dependents, but 
usually they are less likely to have dependents than older people.

Protection. Consumer protection attempts to make the consumption of goods and services less risky for

businesses do not try to protect consumers from unsafe products, then government agencies will enforce 
laws that require businesses to do so. Consumer spending is the total amount of money that is spent on 
products that are obtained for personal use. Consumer confidence is the faith that ultimate product users 
have in a business and/or  its products. Consumer marketing involves all activities that help make goods 
available to ultimate product users.

95,"96. Which of the following factors is most likely to increase a policyholder's car insurance premium?  
",A. Owning an inexpensive used car,B. Receiv ing one or more driving violations,C. Living in a rural community,D. Driving a short distance to work,"96. B 
Receiving one or more driving violations. A dri ver's car insurance premium is likely to increase if the 
driver has received one or more driving violations. If a driver gets a speeding ticket or receives a citation 
for causing a car accident, their insurance company is likely to increase their premium. The reason the 
premium increases is because the driver has exhibited careless behavior and poses an increased risk on 
the road, which often results in additional claims. Driving long work commutes, owning expensive cars, 
and living in congested, urban area s are other factors that may increase a driver's car insurance 
premium.

",A. covers the insured for a time period of 25 years.,B. accumulates cash value over time.,C. covers only the insured's burial expenses.,D. requires policyholders to pay low premiums annually.,"98. B 
Accumulates cash value over time. Life insurance is a contract between a policyholder and an insurance 
carrier and states t hat the insurance carrier will provide the beneficiary of the insured with a certain 
amount of money upon the insured's death. A policyholder who purchases a whole life insurance policy 
pays a level premium at specific intervals for the insured's entire li fe from the time of purchase. There are 
no time limits (e.g., 25 years) on insurance coverage for whole life insurance policies. Coverage 
continues as long as the premiums are being paid. Because the whole life insurance policy accumulates 
cash, money can be borrowed or withdrawn from the cash value of the policy if certain criteria are met. 
After the insured's death, the policy's beneficiary may use some of the money to cover the insured's 
burial expenses. Premium amounts for whole life insurance vary by p olicy and do not need to be paid on 
an annual basis. The premiums are paid according to the terms of the contract, which are usually 
monthly, quarterly, or annually.

",A. Be combative,B. Research ahead of time,C. Leave terms open,D. Agree with the salesperson,"99. B 
Research ahead of time. Being prepared is an important aspect of effectively negotiating a good deal. 
Everett should research the vehicle options in his price range, becom e familiar with the language, and 
learn about other factors such as interest rates. This information will help Everett know when and how to 
negotiate. Being combative is not necessarily a good strategy; instead, the most successful negotiators 
work togethe r with one another to find a mutually beneficial solution. Leaving terms open is not a good 
idea; rather, it is better to solidify and close the deal when you are satisfied. Agreeing with the 
salesperson is not necessarily a good negotiation strategy, beca use it is important to have a degree of

Owners often use business plans as a tool to help them achieve their objectives.,D. A corporation  is the only legal form of business ownership that should develop a business plan.,"100. C 
Owners often use business plans as a tool to help them achieve their objectives. The business plan  is a 
written document that outlines each area of the business and the strategies it will use to accomplish 
business goals. The document helps business owners and managers carry out and monitor objectives 
and evaluate the accomplishments and outcomes. Lend ing institutions usually like to review a company's 
business plan because it helps them weigh the risks associated with the applicant's loan. An operating 
plan provides information regarding facilities, manufacturing processes, personnel, and materials nee ded 
to produce products. All types of businesses should develop business plans, including sole 
proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and hybrids.
