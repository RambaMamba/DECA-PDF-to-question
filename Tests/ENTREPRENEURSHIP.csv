",A. Customize the product for each customer,B. Clarify the company's processes,C. Communicate an appealing benefit,D. Convey a high-quality image,"10. C 
Communicate an appealing benefit. A brand promise is a business's agreement (spoken or unspoken) 
with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand c haracteristics and 
values. Before the business can deliver on its brand promise, it must have a product that offers an 
appealing benefit —one that persuades the target market to buy. For example, FedEx provides delivery 
services. The company's brand promise focuses on reliability. Therefore, FedEx promises to get its 
customers' packages to their destinations in a  reliable  manner —safely, quickly, and courteously —every 
time, which is an appealing benefit for most customers. A procedure is the step- by-step process that a 
person follows when performing a specific task. Customization involves maki ng the product unique for 
each customer. Customization, a high-quality image, and the process by which the business  delivers its 
products may be elements of a company's brand promise.

The financial needs to start a new business depend on the nature of the venture. The requirements ( e.g., 
time, money) that a person needs to start a business differ and usually depend on the nature of  the 
business. For example, a person who starts a home-based consulting business does not requi re as much 
money for the startup as a restaurant franchisee does. The franchisee needs to lease space or bu ild a 
facility, purchase kitchen equipment, obtain supplies, hire employees, and pay franchise f ees, which can 
be very expensive. A patent is legal protection that provides an owner the sole rights to an invention  or 
process for a specific time period. Business owners do not always invent goods or processes, so n ot all 
of them need to obtain patent protection.

Provide collateral. There are many ways for entrepreneurs to obtain financing for new business v entures. 
One way is to obtain a loan from a commercial bank. The loan process generally involv es completing a 
loan application and submitting a business plan to the financial institution. In most situat ions, a bank will 
require the loan applicant to put up collateral in order to obtain the loan. Collatera l is anything of value 
(e.g., car, home) belonging to the borrower that is pledged to the lender to guarantee that the loan will be 
repaid. For example, if a business fails, and the borrower cannot afford to pay back the bank loan, the  
bank can take the borrower's belongings (collateral) as payment for the outstanding loan. Bank s do not 
require loan applicants to close their savings accounts, relinquish contracts, or char ge interest.

Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are all the monies owed to a business by its c ustomers. 
Businesses in need of cash to continue producing and selling goods often use their accou nts receivable

they can repay the debt? 
",A. Liquidity,B. Depreciation,C. Equity,D. Inventory,"36. A 
Liquidity. Liquidity refers to a business's current assets, such as income or savings, that c an be used to 
pay expenses. Assets that are in the form of cash or tangibles that can be sold easily to generate cash 
add to a company's liquidity. When determining financing needs, businesses usually con sider their 
liquidity to decide if they have sufficient funds available to repay the debt. For exa mple, if a business was 
barely covering expenses and had no liquid assets, it probably would decide not to borro w money 
because it would be difficult to make payments on the loan. Depreciation is a reduction i n value of goods 
occurring over a period of time. Equity is the value of the business after all expenses and deb ts have 
been subtracted. Inventory is all the stock a business has on hand.

",A. Being charged a penalty,B. Losing interest on the account,C. Paying a processing fee,D. Receiving a variable rate,"37. A 
Being charged a penalty. When businesses obtain long-term loans, they agree to pay a certain am ount of 
interest to the lending institution over a period of years. If a business pays off the loan be fore it is due, the 
financial institution does not get the interest it expected to receive. In such cases, the financ ial institution 
may charge the business a penalty for prepaying the loan. This penalty may be sizeabl e depending on 
the amount of the loan. A financial institution, rather than a business, loses interest on the account.  A 
business might negotiate a variable rate for a long-term loan and pay a processing fee to originate t he 
loan.

",A. To improve relations,B. To provide service,C. To prevent theft,D. To reduce risk,"38. D 
To reduce risk. There is a risk involved in making loans because a business may default a nd be unable 
to repay the bank. To reduce the risk, lending institutions use certain criteria to evaluate if th e business is 
creditworthy. For example, a bank would run a credit check to find out if the business pays  its bills on 
time. Also, a bank would review the business's financial records to determine if it earned suf ficient 
income to pay expenses and also repay the loan. By carefully evaluating how well a business meets 
certain criteria, a bank is able to reduce the risk involved in making a loan. Lending institution s do not 
evaluate businesses to provide service, prevent theft, or improve relations.

Does the cost of the contract exceed the cost of possible repairs? The business should estimate the 
costs of the most expensive, possible repairs and calculate if these expenses would be more or less  than 
the cost of the service or maintenance contract. If the cost of the repair would be less than the cost of  the 
contract, it may be wise to forgo the contract. The business would consider the need for installation  and 
the availability of training and technical assistance when purchasing equipment. A bus iness does not 
consider how much profit the seller will make on the contract.

operating changes: 
",A. Total revenues exceed projected costs.,B. Estimated sales exceed actual sales.,C. Expected profits are increasing.,D. Accounts receivable are on target.,"66. B 
Estimated sales exceed actual sales. Budgets are only useful if a business compares the budget 
estimates with actual operating conditions. Businesses use the budget information to make dec isions 
about how the business will operate and to make changes when necessary. A business knows that it 
must make operating changes if it compares the level of sales estimated in the budget wit h actual sales 
figures and finds that actual sales are not keeping up with the estimates. This information indicat es that 
the business might not make the expected profit or even have a loss if changes are not made. A 
business probably would not make operating changes if the budget information indicates that tota l 
revenues exceed projected costs, expected profits are increasing, and accounts receivable are  on target.

Monitor the performance of all supply chain partners. To ensure the efficient production and distri bution 
of products, companies should monitor the performance of all supply chain partners on a consistent 
basis. Companies should not ignore underperforming vendors —they should work with them to resolve 
the problem(s) or else replace them. Companies must be careful when introducing new innovations or 
changes to the production process. Introducing change too quickly can overwhelm the supply cha in, 
resulting in failure to meet production quotas. Companies should stick with a single supplier when 
launching a new product in order to avoid overcomplicating the process.
