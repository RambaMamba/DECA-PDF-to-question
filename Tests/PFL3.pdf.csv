One goal of financial regulation is to protect both individual investors and the public from harm. It aims to keep securities and investment companies from taking advantage of customers and from damaging the economy as a whole. Therefore, regulation is considered ethical because it promotes ethical principles such as accountability, respect, and trust.

Unfortunately, her car needs repairs costing $1,000. Without a car, Erin won't be able to travel to work, causing her to lose $500 in wages each week. Which of the following solutions would help Erin make the best  use of her resources: ","A. Spend $1,000 for car repairs, continue working, and delay entry into college for a semester",B. Quit her job and pay the tuition to avoid the financial burden of loans and interest,"C. Get a student loan for tuition, spend $1,000 for car repairs, and continue working to earn income","D.

Erin has a few weeks before tuition is due, so if she repairs the car and continues to work she should have enough time to earn $1,000 to pay for tuition. If Erin quits her job, she will lose her source of income. Erin can avoid a student loan by using the income from her job to pay for tuition.

Many lending institutions and retailers offer credit cards, which allow individuals or businesses to purchase now and pay later.

A 45- year- old male who is a heavy smoker is more likely to pay higher insurance premiums because of his age and smoking habit, which may lead to health problems such as lung cancer and premat ure death.

What action should the salesperson be prepared to take? ,A. Walk away,B. Accept the client's terms to make the sale,C. Continue to negotiate with the client,D. Stress the product's benefits,"98. A Walk away. When salespeople negotiate sales terms, they need to be prepared to w alk away from the sale if they feel the terms will be detrimental to himself/herself or to her/his company. When negotiating, both parties need to ""win""—not just one party. Salespeople want to establish long- term relationships with their clients, so they want to keep the client happy but not harm her/his company. Product benefits would have been stressed earlier in the sales process —the client understands those benefits by the time s/he is ready to negotiate. Continuing to negotiate when the outcome will damage the company tends to waste the time and effort of both parties. SOURCE: SE:392 SOURCE: FD SOURCE: Brudner, E.

C Planning an expansion. A business plan is the written business guide that describes how a business will operate and achieve its objectives. It serves as a blueprint for the business's success. Because internal and external conditions change, businesses should review and update their business plans as needed. Because expansion plans often involve hiring more employees, adding new products, and building new facilities, businesses need to change their objectives and s trategies in their business plans to reflect the changes. In addition, expansion often requires businesses to obtain loans from banks. Banks usually require businesses to submit their business plans as part of the loan- application process. Capabilities are summarized in the SWOT analysis. Stock values may be a strength or weakness described in the SWOT analysis. Businesses do not need to update their business plans when submitting routine (monthly) financial reports.
